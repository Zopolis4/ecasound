       Ecawave is a simple graphical sound file editor. The user-
       interface is based on Qt libraries, while almost all audio
       functionality is taken directly from  ecasound  libraries.
       As  ecawave is designed for editing large audio files, all
       processing is done direct-to-disk. Simple waveform caching
       is  used to speed-up file operations. Ecawave supports all
       audio file formats and effect algorithms provided by  eca-
       sound libraries. This includes ALSA and OSS soundcard sup-
       port, wav, aiff, raw, mp3, snd and lots more.

       Ecawave's user-interface is designed to  be  intuitive  to
       use.  There are no menubars and no hidden functionality. I
       guess you could call this WYSIWYCD - what you see is  what
       you  can do. You should able to do most tasks using short-
       cut keys (ALT + key combinations).
