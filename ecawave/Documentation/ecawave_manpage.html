<p><h2>NAME</h2>
    ecawave - audio file editor based on Qt and ecasound libraries
<p><h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    
<strong>ecawave</strong> [audio_file.ext]
<p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    
<p>Ecawave is a simple graphical sound file editor. The user-interface is
based on Qt libraries, while almost all audio functionality is taken 
directly from ecasound libraries. As ecawave is designed for editing 
large audio files, all processing is done direct-to-disk. Simple 
waveform caching is used to speed-up file operations. Ecawave supports 
all audio file formats and effect algorithms provided by ecasound
libraries. This includes ALSA and OSS soundcard support, wav, aiff,
raw, mp3, snd and lots more.
<p><h2>INTERFACE</h2>
    
<p>Ecawave's user-interface is designed to be intuitive to use. There
are no menubars and no hidden functionality. I guess you could 
call this WYSIWYCD - what you see is what you can do. You should 
able to do most tasks using shortcut keys (ALT + key combinations). 
<p><h2>FILES</h2>
    
<p><em>~/.ecawaverc</em>
	Ecawave user preferences.
<p><em>~/.ecasoundrc</em>
	Resource file used by libecasound. If the file doesn't exist, it 
	is created with default values. See ecasoundrc(5) for more info.
