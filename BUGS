*** Ecasound - Known Bugs/Features                                  ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reporting bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please send your bug reports to the ecasound-list mailing list (see
README or http://eca.cx/mlists.php for list contact information).

If the bug (or feature request) cannot be solved immediately (or
getting a response takes longer than you care to wait for), feel free
to add the item to the sourceforge.net tracker (see below). It is
also a good idea to send a note to the list that you have added
a new item as the sourceforge.net tracker is not monitored by
all developers.

To get the best results, see for example Simon Tatham's excellent 
article on 'How to Report Bugs Effectively' (if you are in a hurry, 
skip to the summary at the end of the article :)):

Ecasound bug tracker at sourceforge.net
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ecasound has used the sourceforge.net bug tracker since Jan/2006:

  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4605&atid=104605

This tracker is used to monitor longstanding bugs and 
feature/improvement items.

Ecasound Development Items - '(edi-x)' codes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ecasound Development Item concept is used for keeping track of 
bugs, open issues, enhancement proposals, and other similar issues.
For a full list of EDI items, see 'Documentation/edi-list.txt' or
on the web at http://www.eca.cx/ecasound -> 'EDIs' menu item.

There is currently no good split between what is an EDI item and
what is tracked at sourceforge.net's tracker, so feel free to use 
whichever you feel more comfortable with, and crosslink if/when 
needed between the bug tracker and this EDI list.

Known Bugs and Features (not in other issue trackers)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the below items, some known missing features have been
listed in the 'TODO' file (in same directory as this file).

- commas in filenames given as arguments to '-i' and '-o' options need
  to be either escaped with backslashes (-i foo\\,bar.wav) or quoted
  with doublequotes (-i "foo,bar.wav")
- certain combinations of glibc and linux-2.6 kernels cause the 'cs-edit' 
  EIAM command to fail (ecasound exits back to shell after the command); 
  as a workaround, set the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 environment variable
  before running ecasound; see http://people.redhat.com/drepper/assumekernel.html
  for background information on LD_ASSUME_KERNEL
- ecasound cannot parse ogg and flac headers so correct audio
  format parameters must be set manually with ecasound's '-f' option
- pitch shifter (-ei) doesn't work with all real-time audio object
  types (for instance JACK)
- ecasound crashes if /dev/midi points to an invalid rawmidi device
- MIDI-ops like '-km' cannot be used in presets
- controller sources and big buffersizes
	- distortion results for example if sine-oscillators
  	  are used with big buffersize (-b:X) settings
