Summary: ecasound - multitrack audio processing tool
Group: Applications/Sound

%description
Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Several
open-source audio packages, like for instance ALSA, OSS, mpg123, lame, 
libaudiofile and MikMod, are directly supported. One of the advantages 
of ecasound's chain-based design is that effects can easily be 
combined both in series and in parallel. Oscillators and MIDI-CCs 
can be used for controlling effect parameters. Included user-interfaces 
are ecasound - a versatile console mode interface, qtecasound - 
a Qt-based X-interface and various command-line utils suitable for 
batch processing.
