Ecasound bug tracker at sourceforge.net
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ecasound bug tracker at sourceforge.net is also used to track
feature requests:

   - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4605&atid=104605

This tracker is used to monitor longstanding bugs and 
feature/improvement items. It replaces the old Ecasound Development
Item practise (items marked with 'edi-x' tags) that was used
between 2002-08.

Help - developer in trouble
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Please report if Ecasound does not compile out-of-the-box on your 
  system!

- Ecasound compiles on FreeBSD (3.1-4.7), Solaris (2.6-2.8), 
  Mac OS X (10.3-10.4.2) and Cygwin (1.3.20) -- How about other 
  UNIX platforms... other BSDs, IRIX, AIX, HPUX?
