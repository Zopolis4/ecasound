1. Summary of changes in this release
-------------------------------------

Update pyecasound and ecamonitor to work with Python3.
Python2.7 or newer is now required. The old C based
implementation of ECI for Python is dropped completely.

minor fixes to compiler warnings, LADSPA plugin capability

2. What is Ecasound?
--------------------

Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio processing.
It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, recording and format
conversions, as well as for multitrack effect processing, mixing,
recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio
inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Effects and audio objects can be
combined in various ways, and their parameters can be controlled by
operator objects like oscillators and MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode
user-interface is included in the package.

Primary platform for running Ecasound is GNU/Linux. Ecasound can also be
run on many UNIX-derived systems such as FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Solaris.
Limited support for Windows is available through Cygwin. Ecasound is
licensed under the GPL. The Ecasound Control Interface (ECI) is licensed
under the LGPL.
