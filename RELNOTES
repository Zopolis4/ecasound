subject: Ecasound 2.8.y released

1. Summary of changes in this release
-------------------------------------

TBD

2. What is Ecasound?
--------------------

Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio processing.
It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, recording and format
conversions, as well as for multitrack effect processing, mixing,
recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio
inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Effects and audio objects can be
combined in various ways, and their parameters can be controlled by
operator objects like oscillators and MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode
user-interface is included in the package.

Primary platform for running Ecasound is GNU/Linux. Ecasound can also be
run on many UNIX-derived systems such as FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Solaris.
Limited support for Windows is available through Cygwin. Ecasound is
licensed under the GPL. The Ecasound Control Interface (ECI) is licensed
under the LGPL.

3. Changes in 2.8.x series
--------------------------

* The int-float conversion routines have been modified to be symmetric 
  (previously asymmetric). As this impacts all use-cases involving fixed
  point audio, the minor version was bumped to reflect the change.
  Ecasound now scales with 2^N for both int-to-float and float-to-int.
  For 0dBFS signals created in floating point domain, and normalized
  to [-1,1] range, the positive values are clipped just before 0dbFS to
  avoid overflow (positive values exceeding 2^N-1).

  Pointers to how other projects handle this issue:

    - Blog entry to which the above is a response:

* Bugfixes to loop objects, jack_multi, false DBC warnings, seek 
  support for -klkg.
