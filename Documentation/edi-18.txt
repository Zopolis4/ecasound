(edi-18) Intelligent system for setting the internal sample rate.
	- submitted: smassy, 17.10.2001

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details:

- work still to be done
  - track down all places where sample rate values are used (at least
    chainsetups, some of the effect objects, audio objects, 
    controller objects, samplebuffer objs) 
  - make all components able to react to changing sample rate

  - When all objects have the same sr, use it as internal sr also.
  - When objects have different sr always set internal sr equal to the highest
    sr connected in the cs.
  example: 
  if (-i:48000 && -o:48000) { sr = 48000 }
  if (-i:44100 && -o:22050 && -o:48000) { sr = 48000 }
 
  That would improve ecasound's ease of use for many as well as its
  apparent sound quality to a new user; because right now as soon as the
  internal sr and the objects' sr differ, sound quality drops
  dramatically because of the way ecasound converts sr's (as we
  discussed on the list a while ago.)
  Also maybe something similar should be done for rt objects.  Because
  if you have something like `-i:test.wav -o:alsa" though test.wav is at
  a sample rate of 11025, alsa device is still open at 44100; ideally,
  -f and -sr should only be used to override (or for headerless
  formats).

  - should be placed to ECA_CHAINSETUP::enable() (after input
    and output init)
  - ECA_ENGINE takes caref of initializing chains, so it's 
    not a problem
  - issue a warning if -sr was not given and resampling results

What if we just removed implicit resampling altogether?  My reasoning
behind this is:

- current resampling is not high-quality (mostly just causes
  bad pr for ecasound) 
- for any kind of realtime work, resampling should _not_
  be used (wastes cpu-resource for no good reason)
- only real use for resampling is file format conversions
- by removing the "resampling_needed()" check we
  make the common code path a little bit faster (although
  not much) and cleaner
- we avoid problems with unexpected resampling

As a result you could not execute a chainsetup, where sampling rate of
one or more objects differs from engine's sampling rate.

If this was done, implementation of 'edi-18' would be reduced to:

- find the common sampling rate between audio objects
- if found: set engine's rate to it
- else: print an error message

This would also make the -sr option obsolete.

For cases where resampling is needed, a new audio object type could be
added - something like:

ecasound -f:16,2,44100 -i resample,22050hz_file.wav,44100 -o output.wav

As a bonus, as now resampling would be a special-case operation, we are   
not limited to light resampling algorithms. In practise we could use a    
much more high-quality (=cpu-heavy) alternative (if someone has the time  
to do it).
