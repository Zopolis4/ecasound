<h2>1: Preface</h2>
<p>This document describes ecasound's use from user's point of view. 
In addition to the actual user/client-programs, all essential ecasound 
library concepts and features are also discussed. To avoid duplicating
documentation, I've used references to other sources whenever suitable. 
For instance, ecasound's man pages are in a very good shape.
They are also available in HTML-format.

<h2>2: Introduction</h2>
<p><a name="l3"></a>
<h3>2.1: What is ecasound?</h3>
<p>Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. 
Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their
parameters can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators 
and MIDI-CCs. As most functionality is located in shared libraries,
creating alternative user-interfaces is easy. A versatile console mode
interface is included in the package.
<p><a name="l4"></a>
<h3>2.2: History</h3>
<p>I've programmed ecasound for my own recording purposes. The first 
versions ran under IBM Os/2. I used them for finalizing my analog 
4-track recordings. My 4-track was a nice tool, but it had its limits.
So eventually I started to use Windows-based multitrack software. I
still used ecasound for fx processing and finalizing. When I 
ported ecasound to Linux, a lot of the code was rewritten from 
scratch. During this I also added multitrack capabilities
to ecasound. It took a lot of work, but in the end I was able to 
get rid of all my Windows recording software. Nowadays I use 
ecasound for all my music projects. Because of this, I also 
continue to improve and develop ecasound.

<h2>3: Ecasound library concepts</h2>
<p><a name="l6"></a>
<strong>3.0.1: Chain</strong><p>
Chain is a simple signal flow abstraction. Every chain has one input
and one output. All chain operators and their controllers are attached
to chains. Chain can be muted and bypassed.
<p><a name="l7"></a>
<strong>3.0.2: Audio object</strong><p>
Audio object is a really generic concept. Practically anything that 
is able to produce or receive audio data can be an ecasound audio 
object. Currently there's support for soundcard drivers/subsystems, 
various file formats and various types of data-piping.
Notice that objects can be used both for input and output.
<p><a name="l8"></a>
<strong>3.0.3: Chain operators and controllers</strong><p>
Chain operators are used to process and analyze sample data.
Controllers are used to control individual chain operator parameters.
Both types of objects are attached to chains. Term <em>chain object</em> refers
to all objects that can be attached to chains - ie. operators and 
controllers.
<p><a name="l9"></a>
<strong>3.0.4: Chainsetup</strong><p>
Chainsetup is the central data object. All other objects (inputs,
outputs, chains, etc) are connected to some chainsetup. There can be 
many chainsetups but only one can be connected. Similarly only
one chainsetup can be selected. Chainsetups are also used for
loading and saving state information. The format used is identical to 
the command-line syntax used by the console mode user-interface, which 
makes it easy to edit saved chainsetups. See
<a href="../ecasound_manpage.html">ecasound(1)</a> for details.
<p><a name="l10"></a>
<strong>3.0.5: Concept of current position</strong><p>
Only audio objects have a current position. When you change 
position of a chain, you're changing position of audio objects
connected to that chain. When you change global engine position,
all chains (= all audio objects attached to them) are affected.
<p><a name="l11"></a>
<strong>3.0.6: Interactive-mode</strong><p>
Ecasound library can be controlled with simple commands. 
This is called the interactive-mode. All programs linked
to ecasound library can use this facility. 
<p>

<h2>4: Using</h2>
<p>
<a name="l13"></a>
<h3>4.1: Where to start?</h3>
There's no one single way to use ecasound. You can use it as 
a simple glue component for doing tasks, which aren't handled by
other applications you are using, or because ecasound does these tasks
more easily. But ecasound can also serve as the centre of your studio 
setup, doing everything from effects processing to multitrack
recording and mixing. 
<p>But this flexibility doesn't come for free. It's difficult to describe
ecasound's features in a few phrases. Because of this, I encourage
new users to start from ecasound <a href="../examples.html">examples.html</a>
page. It isn't a perfect introduction, and definitely not the only way 
to use ecasound, but it does give an overall view of what can be done
with ecasound, and more importantly, that most tasks are actually
quite easy to perform.
<p>
<a name="l14"></a>
<h3>4.2: Creating ecasound chainsetups</h3>
<a name="l15"></a>
<strong>4.2.1: General</strong><p>
Here are a few rules that help writing valid chainsetups. Whether
you are writing chainsetup files (.ecs), using command-line arguments, 
using a graphical frontend, etc, these rules are always useful:
<p><dl>
<li >Every chain has exactly _one_ input and _one_ output.
<li >All inputs and outputs must be connected to some chain.
<li >For every input/output, there must be exactly _one_
    input/output specification (example specification: '-i:file.ext').
<li >All routing from/to chains is based on selecting a set of chains
    and then specifying an input or output (example: '-a:1,2 -i:file.ext').
<li >All audio copying and mixing is done channel-wise. If you attach 
    a 4-channel input and a two-channel output to a chain, chain 
    will have 4 channels of audio, but only the first two channels
    will be written to the output file.

<strong>4.2.2: Audio objects</strong><p>
<p>
<p><strong>ewf - ecasound wave file</strong><br><br>
Ecasound wave file (.ewf) is a simple wrapper format for controlling 
other audio objects. One important feature of ewf is the ability to seek
beyond end position. When first write operation is performed, current 
file position is stored into the .ewf file and the actual audio object
is opened for writing. When reading, you get silence until the offset 
position is reached. Shortly put, this is a practical way to save disk 
space when doing multitrack recording. Newer versions of ewf-format 
support looping, ranges, etc
<p>Ewf-files themselves are simple ascii files that contain key-value pairs. The 
format used is the same as with ecasound resource files. See
<a href="../ecasoundrc_manpage.html">ecasoundrc(5)</a> manual page for more
info. Currently recognized keywords are:
<p><dl>
<li > source - audio object name [read,write]
<li > offset - insert audio object at offset (seconds) [read,write] 
<li > start-position - start offset inside audio object (seconds) [read]
<li > length - how much of audio object data is used (seconds) [read]
<li > looping - whether to loop sample data (true or false) [read]
</dl>
<p>
subsubsubsubsect(Example of ewf use)
Let's take an example .ewf file:
<pre>

-- test.ewf --
source = test.wav
offset = 5.0
start-position = 2.0
length = 3.0
looping = true
--cut--

</pre>

So what happens when you issue "ecasound -i test.ewf -o /dev/dsp". The
first 5 secs will be silent, then ecasound starts to read data from
test.wav (offset inside test.wav is 2 secs). After 8 secs (offset + 
length) of playback, we'll loop back to start (2 sec from beginning of 
test.wav).
<p>
<p><strong>Audio loop devices</strong><br><br>
Loop devices were added to ecasound version 1.7.0. You use them like this:
<pre>

--cut--
# note, the second loop parameter is the loop id-number;
# it is used to associate loop inputs with correct loop outputs
ecasound -a:1 -i:some.mp3 -o:loop,1
         -a:2 -i:another.mp3 -o:loop,1
         -a:3 -i:loop,1 -o /dev/dsp -ea:200
--cut--

</pre>

Both inputs are eventually routed to chain "3", where a -ea:200 is
applied to the signal. This does have one downside, loop device
adds latency (-b:x -&gt; latency of x frames). 
<p>
<a name="l17"></a>
<strong>4.2.3: Chain operators</strong><p>
See <a href="../ecasound_manpage.html">ecasound(1)</a>.
<p>
<p><strong>Some examples of the use of gate operators</strong><br><br>
Gates are just like any other chain operators. They are assigned to 
a chain, and process buffers of samples data. With gates you can
easily crop sections of audio files, and do automatic volume-based 
cropping. For instance.
<pre>

--cut--
###| /empty1 |$ ls -la guitar.wav
-rw-rw-r--   1 kaiv     kaiv     15790124 Sep 30 23:27 guitar.wav

###| /empty1 |$ ecasound_debug -i guitar.wav -o gate-test.wav -gc:60,1

###| /empty1 |$ ls -la gate-test.wav
-rw-rw-r--   1 kaiv     kaiv       180268 Dec 12 22:13 gate-test.wav
--cut--

</pre>

This cut the section [60:00 sec -&gt; 61:00 sec] from guitar.wav into
gate-test.wav. The old '-gc' would have just muted all audio outside the
[60,61] region. The threshold gate is used similarly:
<pre>

--cut--
###| /empty1 |$ ecasound_debug -i gate-test.wav -o gate-test-rms.wav -ge:11.2,5,1

###| /empty1 |$ ecasound_debug -i gate-test.wav -o gate-test-peak.wav -ge:5,5,0

###| /empty1 |$ ls -la gate*wav
-rw-rw-r--   1 kaiv     kaiv       163884 Dec 12 22:18 gate-test-peak.wav
-rw-rw-r--   1 kaiv     kaiv       143404 Dec 12 22:17 gate-test-rms.wav
-rw-rw-r--   1 kaiv     kaiv       180268 Dec 12 22:13 gate-test.wav
--cut--

</pre>

In the first one, gate is opened when the RMS-volume goes over the 11.2%
threshold, and closed when RMS-volume falls below 5%. In the second,
both entry and close thresholds are 5% (peak volume).

<strong>4.2.4: Controllers</strong><p>
See <a href="../ecasound_manpage.html">ecasound(1)</a>.
<p>
<a name="l19"></a>
<strong>4.2.5: Effect presets</strong><p>
Ecasound has a powerful effect preset system that allows you to create
new effects by combining basic effects and controllers.
<p>Presets can be stored into separate files or they can be stored
into a global database. Either way, the preset format is the same
(also see <a href="../ecasoundrc_manpage.html">ecasoundrc(5)</a> man page, 
the same parsing engine is used):
<pre>
preset_name = effects controllers | ... | effects controllers
</pre>

Effects and controllers are specified using the same format as 
used in command-line parsing (-ea:100, -kl:1,0,100,5, etc). You 
can add a new parallel chain using the pipe characher '|'. '\' sign is 
used to continue preset definition on the next line.
<p>
<p><strong>Example of preset use</strong><br><br>
Ecasound effect presets are in fact small ecasound engines pretending
to be effects. Here's an example of multi-chain effect preset:
<p><pre>

-- file 'bassbooster.ecp' --
# let's put the low freqs into one chain and high freqs in another
bassbooster = -efl:2000 -ea:200 | -efh:2000 -ea:50
# note, the '|' sign separates parallel chains
--cut--

</pre>

<p>Once defined, you can use the preset in the following way:
<pre>

--cut--
ecasound -a:1 -i:some.mp3 -pf:bassbooster.ecp
         -a:2 -i:another.mp3 -pf:bassbooster.ecp
         -a:1,2 -o:/dev/dsp
--cut--

</pre>

<strong>4.2.6: LADSPA plugins</strong><p>
Ecasound supports LADSPA-effect plugins (Linux Audio Developer's Simple
Plugin API). See <a href="../ecasound_manpage.html">ecasound(1)</a> for more
info.
<p>
<a name="l21"></a>
<h3>4.3: Configuration</h3>
User preferences are stored to <em>~/.ecasouncrc</em>. See 
<a href="../ecasoundrc_manpage.html">ecasoundrc(5)</a> manual page for more 
info.
<p>By default, files for effects and oscillator presets are 
in <em>/usr/local/share/ecasound</em>.
