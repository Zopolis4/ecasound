<h2>1: Preface</h2>
<p>This document describes ecasound's use from user's point of view. 
In addition to the actual user/client-programs, all essential ecasound 
library concepts and features are also discussed. To avoid duplicating
documentation, I've used referenced to other sources whenever suitable. 
For instance, ecasound's man pages are in a very good shape.
They are also available in HTML-format.

<h2>2: Introduction</h2>
<p><a name="l3"></a>
<h3>2.1: What is ecasound?</h3>
<p>Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Several
open-source audio packages, like for instance ALSA, OSS, mpg123, lame, 
libaudiofile and MikMod, are directly supported. One of the advantages 
of ecasound's chain-based design is that effects can easily be 
combined both in series and in parallel. Oscillators and MIDI-CCs 
can be used for controlling effect parameters. Included user-interfaces 
are ecasound - a versatile console mode interface, qtecasound - 
a Qt-based X-interface and various command-line utils suitable for 
batch processing.

<h3>2.2: History</h3>
<p>I've programmed ecasound for my own recording purposes. The first 
versions ran under IBM Os/2. I used them for finalizing my analog 
4-track recordings. My 4-track was a nice tool, but it had its limits.
So eventually I started to use Windows-based multitrack software. I
still used ecasound for fx processing and finalizing. When I 
ported ecasound to Linux, a lot of the code was rewritten from 
scratch. During this I also added multitrack capabilities
to ecasound. It took a lot of work, but in the end I was able to 
get rid of all my Windows recording software. Nowadays I use 
ecasound for all my music projects. Because of this, I also 
continue to improve and develop ecasound.

<h2>3: Ecasound library features</h2>
<p>
<a name="l6"></a>
<h3>3.1: Concepts</h3>
<a name="l7"></a>
<strong>3.1.1: Chain</strong><p>
Chain is a simple signal flow abstraction. Every chain has one input
and one output. All chain operators and their controllers are attached
to chains. Chain can be muted, unmuted and it can be bypassed.
<p><a name="l8"></a>
<strong>3.1.2: Audio object</strong><p>
Audio object is a really generic concept. Practically anything that 
is able to produce or receive audio data can be an ecasound audio 
object. Currently there's support for soundcard drivers/subsystems, 
various file formats and various types of data-piping.
Notice that inputs and outputs are not separated in any way. 
<p><a name="l9"></a>
<strong>3.1.3: Chain operators and controllers</strong><p>
Chain operators are used to process and analyze sample data.
Controllers are used to control individual chain operator parameters.
Both types of objects are attached to chains.
<p><a name="l10"></a>
<strong>3.1.4: Chainsetup</strong><p>
Chainsetup is the central data object. All other objects (inputs,
outputs, chains, etc) are connected to some chainsetup. There can be 
many chainsetups but only one can be connected. Similarly only
one chainsetup can be selected. Chainsetups are also used for
loading and saving. The format used is identical to the command-line
syntax used by the console mode user-interface, which makes it 
easy to edit saved chainsetups. See
<a href="../ecasound_manpage.html">ecasound(1)</a> for details.
<p><a name="l11"></a>
<strong>3.1.5: Concept of current position</strong><p>
Only audio objects have a current position. When you change 
position of a chain, you're changing position of audio objects
connected to that chain. When you change global engine position,
all chains (= all audio objects attached to them) are affected.
<p><a name="l12"></a>
<strong>3.1.6: Interactive-mode</strong><p>
Ecasound library can be controlled with simple commands. 
This is called the interactive-mode. All programs linked
to ecasound library can use this facility. 
<p>
<a name="l13"></a>
<h3>3.2: Configuration</h3>
User preferences are stored to <em>~/.ecasouncrc</em>. See 
<a href="../ecasoundrc_manpage.html">ecasoundrc(5)</a> manual page for more 
info.
<p>By default, files for effects and oscillator presets are 
in <em>/usr/local/share/ecasound</em>.
<p>
<a name="l14"></a>
<h3>3.3: Audio objects</h3>
<a name="l15"></a>
<strong>3.3.1: ewf - ecasound wave file</strong><p>
Ecasound wave file (.ewf) is a simple wrapper format for RIFF WAVE
(.wav) files that allows seeking beyond end position. When first write
operation is performed, current file position is stored into the 
.ewf file and corresponding .wav is opened for writing. When reading,
you get silence until the offset position. Shortly put, this is a
handy way to save disk space when doing multitrack recording.

ecasound HTML-documentation (../examples.html).
