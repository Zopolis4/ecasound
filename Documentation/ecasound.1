       Ecasound  is  a  software  package designed for multitrack
       audio processing. It can be used  for  simple  tasks  like
       audio  playback, recording and format conversions, as well
       as for multitrack effect processing, mixing, recording and
       signal  recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio
       inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Several open-source
       audio packages, like for instance ALSA, OSS, mpg123, lame,
       libaudiofile and MikMod, are directly  supported.  One  of
       the  advantages  of  ecasound's chain-based design is that
       effects can easily be combined both in series and in  par-
       allel.  Oscillators  and MIDI-CCs can be used for control-
       ling effect parameters. Included user-interfaces are  eca-
       sound - a versatile console mode interface, qtecasound - a
       Qt-based X-interface and various command-line utils  suit-
       able for batch processing.

       -c     Starts ecasound in interactive mode. In interactive
              mode  you can control ecasound with simple commands
              ("start", "stop",  "pause",  etc.).  See  ecasound-
              iam(1).


       -d:debug level
              Set the debug level. Default is 0.


       -q     Quiet mode, no output.

       -n:name
              Set the name of chainsetup to 'name'. If not speci-
              fied, defaults either to "command-line-setup" or to

              the  file  name  from  which chainsetup was loaded.
              Whitespaces are not allowed.


       -s[:]chainsetup-file
              Create a new chainsetup from file 'chainsetup-file'
              and  add  it to the current session. Chainsetup can
              contain  inputs,  outputs,  chains,  effects,  con-
              trollers,  etc.  A session, on the other hand, con-
              tains all the chainsetups. Although only one chain-
              setup  can  be  connected at a time, you can switch
              between them on-the-fly.


       -sr:sample_rate
              Set internal sampling rate. This  can  be  used  to
              improve  realtime  performance  or  to avoid resam-
              pling. Default is 44100 samples per second.


       GGEENNEERRAALL


       -a:chainname1, chainname2, ...
              Select active signal chains.  All  effects,  inputs
              and  outputs are assigned to these chains. If there
              are no -a options given,  default  chain  is  used.
              Chain  name  'all'  is  reserved and means that all
              chains are selected. By giving multiple -a options,
              you can control to which chains effects, inputs and
              outputs are assigned to. Look at the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS  sec-
              tion for more detailed info about the usage of this
              option.


       -b:buffer size
              Sets the size of buffer  in  samples  (must  be  an
              exponent  of 2). This is quite an important option.
              For real-time processing, you should  set  this  as
              low  as  possible  to  reduce the processing delay.
              Some machines can handle buffer values as low as 64
              and  128.  In some circumstances (for instance when
              using oscillator envelopes) small buffer sizes will
              make envelopes act more smoothly. When not process-
              ing in real-time (all inputs and outputs are normal
              files), values between 512 - 4096 often give better
              results. Default is 1024.


       -m:mix-mode
              Force ecasound to use mix mode 'mix_mode'. 'auto' =
              automatic   (default),   'simple'   =    only   one
              input/chain/output,  'normal'  =   normal   single-
              threaded   mode  and  'mthreaded'  =  multithreaded



                            03.01.2000                          2

              mixing. In most cases, ecasound is able to find out
              the correct mode automatically.


       -r     Use  realtime  scheduling policy (SCHED_FIFO). This
              is impossible if ecasound doesn't have  root  priv-
              iledges. Beware! This gives better performance, but
              can cause total lock-ups if something goes wrong.


       -x     Truncate outputs. If this isn't set, ecasound opens
              all  outputs  -  if format allows it - in readwrite
              mode.


       -z:feature
              Enable 'feature'. 'db' enables double-buffering for
              audio  inputs  that  support  it. 'psr' enables the
              _p_r_e_c_i_s_e_-_s_a_m_p_l_e_-_r_a_t_e_s mode for OSS-devices. See eca-
              soundrc(5).

       -t:seconds
              Set  processing time in seconds (doesn't have to be
              an integer value).  If processing time  isn't  set,
              engine stops when all inputs are finished.


       -tl    Enable looping. When processing is finished, engine
              will start again from the initial position.

       See ecasound user's guide for more detailed documentation.


       -f:sample_format,channel,sample-rate
              Set default sampling parameters. These are used for
              all following  input  and  output  files  or  until
              another  -f  is  specified. If no -f option is pre-
              sent, ecasound uses s16_le/2ch/44100 as the default
              value.  Some  audio objects may override this alto-
              gether (for instance, RIFF  WAVE  inputs  and  out-
              puts).

              Sample format is given as a a formatted string. The
              first letter is either "u", "s" and "f"  (unsigned,
              signed, floating point). The following number spec-
              ifies sample size in  bits.  If  sample  is  little
              endian, "_le" is added to the end. Similarly if big
              endian,  "_be"  is  added.  If  endianess  is   not

              specified,  host byte-oder is used.  Currently sup-
              ported formats are "u8"  (same  as  "8"),  "s16_le"
              (same as "16") and "s16_be".


       -y:seconds
              Set starting position for last specified input/out-
              put.


       -i[:]input-file-or-device
              Specifies a new input source that is  connected  to
              all selected chains.  Connecting multiple inputs to
              the same chain isn't possible. Input  can  be  a  a
              file,  device  or  some  other  audio  object  (see
              below).  If the input is a file, its type is deter-
              mined using the file name extension. Currently sup-
              ported formats are RIFF WAVE files (.wav), audio-cd
              tracks (.cdr), ecasound ewf-files (.ewf), RAW audio
              data (.raw) and MPEG files (.mp2,.mp3). Also,  for-
              mats  supported  by the SGI audiofile library: AIFF
              (.aiff, .aifc, .aif) and Sun/NeXT audio files (.au,
              .snd).  MikMod  is also supported (.xm, .mod, .s3m,
              .it, etc). Supported devices are OSS audio  devices
              (/dev/dsp*),   ALSA   audio  and  loopback  devices
              (/dev/snd/pcm*, alsalb). If no  inputs  are  speci-
              fied, the first non-option (doesn't start with '-')
              command line argument is considered to be an input.


       -o[:]output-file-or-device
              Works  in  the  same way as the -i option. If no no
              outputs are specified, the default output device is
              used  (see  &tilde;/.ecasoundrc).  Note!  you can't
              output to module formats supported by MikMod  (this
              should be obvious) nor to ALSA's loopback device.

       ALSA devices
              When   using   ALSA   drivers,   in   addition   to
              /dev/snd/pcm* files, you can also use option syntax
              --ii[[::]]aallssaa,,ccaarrdd__nnuummbbeerr,,ddeevviiccee__nnuummbbeerr.


       ALSA loopback device
              By  using  the  ALSA  loopback system, you can grab
              audio data from any other ALSA pcm  device.  Option
              syntax    is    --ii[[::]]aallssaallbb,,ccaarrdd__nnuummbbeerr,,ddeevviiccee__nnuumm--
              bbeerr,,lloooopp__mmooddee. Loopmode is either ""pp"" for looping a
              playback device or ""cc"" for a capture device.

       Null inputs/outputs
              If  you  specify "null" or "/dev/null" as the input
              or output, a null audio device is created. This  is
              useful  if  you  just  want  to analyze sample data
              without writing it to a file.


       System standard streams and named pipes
              You can use standard stream (stdin and  stdout)  by
              giving  "stdin" or "stdout" as the file name. Audio
              data is assumed to be in raw/headerless (.raw) for-
              mat.  If you want to use named pipes, create a them
              with the proper file name extension.

              Insert single-chain preset 'preset_name' to  active
              chains.   See ecasoundrc(5) for info about the pre-
              set file.

       -ev    Analyze sample data to find out how much the signal
              can  be  amplified  without clipping. The resulting
              percent value can be used as a parameter to -ea and
              -eas  effects.  Also prints a statistics table con-
              taining info about stereo-image and  how  different
              sample values are used.


       -ezf   Find  the  optimal  value for DC-adjusting. You can
              use the result as a parameter to -ezx effect.

       -ea:amplify-%
              Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent.


       -eac:amplify-%,channel
              Amplifies signal of channel 'channel' by  amplify-%
              percent. 'channel' ranges from 1...n where n is the
              total number of channels.

              the  largest  amplitude  possible)  reaches   'max-
              clipped-samples', a warning will be issued.


       -ec:rate,threshold
              Compressor  (a  simple one). 'rate' is the compres-
              sion rate in decibels  ('rate'dB  change  in  input
              signal  causes  1dB  change in output). 'threshold'
              varies between 0.0 (silence) and  1.0  (max  ampli-
              tude).


       -eca:peak-level-%, release_time, fastrate, rate
              A  more  advanced compressor (original algorithm by
              John S. Dyson).  If you give a value of  0  to  any
              parameter,  the  default  is  used.  'peak-level-%'
              essentially specifies how hard the peak limiter  is
              pushed.  The default of 69% is good. 'release_time'
              is  given  in  seconds.  This  compressor  is  very
              sophisticated,  and  actually  the  release time is
              complex.  This is one of the dominant release  time
              controls,  but the actual release time is dependent
              on a lot of factors regarding the dynamics  of  the
              audio  in.  'fastrate' is the compression ratio for
              the fast compressor.  This is not really  the  com-
              pression  ratio.   Value of 1.0 is infinity to one,
              while the default 0.50 is 2:1.  Another really good
              value  is  special cased in the code: 0.25 is some-
              what  less  than  2:1,  and  sounds  super  smooth.
              'rate' is the compression ratio for the entire com-
              pressor chain.  The default is 1.0, and  holds  the
              volume   very  constant  without  many  nasty  side
              effects.   However  the  dynamics  in   music   are
              severely  restricted, and a value of 0.5 might keep
              the music more intact.


       -enm:threshold_level_%,th_time,attack,hold,release
              Noise gate. Supports multichannel processing  (each
              channel  processed  separately). When signal ampli-
              tude falls below 'threshold_level_%' percent  (100%
              means maximum amplitude), gate is activated. If the
              signal stays below the threshold for 'th_time'  ms,
              it's  faded out during the attack phase of 'attack'
              ms.  If  the  signal  raises  above  the   'thresh-
              old_level'  and stays there over 'hold' ms the gate
              is released during 'release' ms.


       -epp:right-%
              Normal pan effect. Balance value of 0 means to  pan
              signal  fully  left  and  100  fully  right. If the
              panned signal is a stereo signal,  left  and  right
              channels  aren't  mixed together.  Use the -erm and



                            03.01.2000                          6

              panning.


       -ezx:left-dc-fix-value,right-dc-fix-value
              Adjusts  the  signal DC by 'dc-fix-value'. Use -ezf
              to find the optimal value.


       _F_I_L_T_E_R _E_F_F_E_C_T_S

       -ef1:center_freq, width
              Resonant bandpass filter. 'center_freq' is the cen-
              ter frequency. Width is specified in Hz.


       -ef3:cutoff_freq, reso, gain
              Resonant lowpass filter. 'cutoffr_freq' is the fil-
              ter cutoff frequency. 'reso' means resonance.  Usu-
              ally  the best values for resonance are between 1.0
              and 2.0,  but  you  can  use  even  bigger  values.
              'gain'  is  the  overall gain-factor. It's a simple
              multiplier (1.0 is the  normal  level).  With  high
              resonance  values  it often is useful to reduce the
              gain value.


       -efb:center_freq,width
              Bandpass filter. 'center_freq' is the  center  fre-
              quency. Width is specified in Hz.


       -efh:cutoff_freq
              Highpass   filter.  Only  frequencies  above  'cut-
              off_freq' are passed through.


       -efi:delay_in_samples,radius
              Inverse comb filter. Allows the spikes of the  comb
              to    pass   through.    The   comb   consists   of
              'delay_in_samples/2' spikes. The maximum value  for
              'radius'  is  1.0.  The closer it is to the maximum

       -efl:cutoff_freq
              Lowpass  filter.  Only  frequencies   below   'cut-
              off_freq' are passed through.


       -efr:center_freq,width
              Bandreject filter. 'center_freq' is the center fre-
              quency. Width is specified in Hz.

       -efs:center_freq,width
              Resonator. 'center_freq' is the  center  frequency.
              Width is specified in Hz. Basicly just another res-
              onating bandpass filter.

       -erc:from_channel, to_channel
              Copy channel  'from_channel'  to  'to_channel'.  If
              'to_channel'  doesn't exist, it is created. Channel
              indexing is started from 0.


       -erm:to_channel
              Mix  all  channels  to  channel  'to_channel'.   If
              'to_channel'  doesn't exist, it is created. Channel
              indexing is started from 0.   Channel  indexing  is
              started from 0.

       -etd:delay_time,surround-mode,number_of_delays,mix-%
              Delay  effect.  'delay  time'  is the delay time in
              milliseconds.  'surround-mode' is  a  integer  with
              following  meanings:  0 = normal, 1 = surround, 2 =
              stereo-spread. 'number_of_delays' should  be  obvi-
              ous.  Beware  that  large number of delays and huge
              delay times need a lot of CPU power. 'mix-%' deter-
              mines  how  much  effected (wet) signal is mixed to
              the original.


       -etr:delay-time,surround-mode,feedback-%
              Reverb effect. 'delay time' is the  delay  time  in
              milliseconds.   If  'surround-mode'  is 'surround',
              reverbed signal  moves  around  the  stereo  image.
              'feedback-%'  determines  how  much  effected (wet)
              signal is fed back to the reverb.


       -etf:delay_time
              Fake-stereo effect. The input signal is  summed  to
              mono. The original signal goes to the left channels
              while a delayd version (with delay of 'delay  time'
              milliseconds)  is  goes  to the right. With a delay
              time of 1-40 milliseconds this adds  a  stereo-feel
              to mono-signals.

       -gc:start-time,len
              Time  crop  gate.  Initially  gate is closed. After
              'start-time' seconds has  elapse,  gate  opens  and
              remains open for 'len' seconds.


       -ge:othreshold%, cthold%,volume_mode
              Threshold  gate.  Initially  gate  is closed. It is
              opened when volume goes over 'othreshold'  percent.
              After this, if volume drops below 'cthold' percent,
              gate is closed  and  won't  be  opened  again.   If
              'value_mode'  is 'rms', average RMS volume is used.
              Otherwise peak average is used.

              Controllers  can  be  used  to  dynamically  change
              effect   parameters  during  processing.  All  con-
              trollers are attached to the selected (=usually the
              last  specified  effect/chainop)  effect. The first
              three parameters are common  for  all  controllers.
              'fx_param'  specifies  the  parameter  to  be  con-
              trolled. Value '1' means the first  parameter,  '2'
              the  second and so on. 'low_range' and 'high_range'
              set the value range. You really  should  see  _e_x_a_m_-
              _p_l_e_s_._h_t_m_l for some more info.


       -kos:fx_param,low_range,high_range,freq,i_phase
              Sine  oscillator  with  frequency  of 'freq' Hz and
              initial phase of 'i_phase' times pi.


       -kf:fx_param,low_range,high_range,freq,genosc_number
              Generic oscillator. 'genosc_number' is  the  number
              of the oscillator preset to be loaded. The location
              for the preset file is taken from ./ecasoundrc (see
              _e_c_a_s_o_u_n_d_r_c_(_5_)).


       -kl:fx_param,low_range,high_range,time_in_seconds
              Linear  envelope  that  starts from 'low_range' and
              linearly   increases   to    'high_range'    during
              'time_in_seconds'.  Can  be  used  for  fadeins and
              fadeouts.


       -km:fx_param,low_range,high_range,controller,channel
              MIDI continuous  controller  (control  change  mes-
              sages).   Messages  on  the  MIDI-channel 'channel'
              that are coming from controller number 'controller'
              are  used as the controller source. The MIDI-device
              is specified in ./ecasoundrc  (see  _e_c_a_s_o_u_n_d_r_c_(_5_)).
