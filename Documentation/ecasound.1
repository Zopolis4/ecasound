       Ecasound  is  a  software  package designed for multitrack
       audio processing. It can be used  for  simple  tasks  like
       audio  playback, recording and format conversions, as well
       as for multitrack effect processing, mixing, recording and
       signal  recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio
       inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Several open-source
       audio packages, like for instance ALSA, OSS, mpg123, lame,
       libaudiofile and MikMod, are directly  supported.  One  of
       the  advantages  of  ecasound's chain-based design is that
       effects can easily be combined both in series and in  par-
       allel.  Oscillators  and MIDI-CCs can be used for control-
       ling effect parameters. Included user-interfaces are  eca-
       sound - a versatile console mode interface, qtecasound - a
       Qt-based X-interface and various command-line utils  suit-
       able for batch processing.

       -c     Starts ecasound in interactive mode. In interactive
              mode  you can control ecasound with simple commands
              ("start", "stop",  "pause",  etc.).  See  ecasound-
              iam(1).


       -d:debug_level
              Set  the  debug level to 'debug_level'. This a bit-
              masked value, that defaults  to  3.  See  ECA_DEBUG
              class  documentation  for  more detailed info about
              various debug_level values.


       -D     Print all debug information to stderr  (unbuffered,
              plain output without ncurses).


       -q     Quiet mode, no output. Same as _-_d_:_0.

       -n:name
              Set the name of chainsetup to 'name'. If not speci-
              fied, defaults either to "command-line-setup" or to
              the  file  name  from  which chainsetup was loaded.
              Whitespaces are not allowed.


       -s[:]chainsetup-file
              Create a new chainsetup from file 'chainsetup-file'
              and  add  it to the current session. Chainsetup can
              contain  inputs,  outputs,  chains,  effects,  con-
              trollers,  etc.  A session, on the other hand, con-
              tains all the chainsetups. Although only one chain-
              setup  can  be  connected at a time, you can switch
              between them on-the-fly.


       -sr:sample_rate
              Set internal sampling rate. This  can  be  used  to
              improve  realtime  performance  or  to avoid resam-
              pling. Default is 44100 samples per second.


       GGEENNEERRAALL


       -a:chainname1, chainname2, ...
              Select active signal chains.  All  effects,  inputs
              and  outputs are assigned to these chains. If there
              are no -a options given,  default  chain  is  used.
              Chain  name  'all'  is  reserved and means that all
              chains are selected. By giving multiple -a options,
              you can control to which chains effects, inputs and
              outputs are assigned to. Look at the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS  sec-
              tion for more detailed info about the usage of this
              option.


       -b:buffer size
              Sets the size of buffer  in  samples  (must  be  an
              exponent  of 2). This is quite an important option.
              For real-time processing, you should  set  this  as
              low  as  possible  to  reduce the processing delay.
              Some machines can handle buffer values as low as 64



                            12.12.2000                          2





ecasound(1)            Multimedia software            ecasound(1)


              and  128.  In some circumstances (for instance when
              using oscillator envelopes) small buffer sizes will
              make envelopes act more smoothly. When not process-
              ing in real-time (all inputs and outputs are normal
              files), values between 512 - 4096 often give better
              results. Default is 1024.


       -m:mix-mode
              Force ecasound to use mix mode 'mix_mode'. 'auto' =
              automatic   (default),   'simple'   =    only   one
              input/chain/output and 'normal'  =  normal  single-
              threaded  mode.  In most cases, ecasound is able to
              find out the correct mode automatically.


       -r:sched_priority
              Use realtime scheduling policy  (SCHED_FIFO).  This
              is  impossible  if ecasound doesn't have root priv-
              iledges. Beware! This gives better performance, but
              can  cause  total lock-ups if something goes wrong.
              The 'sched_priority' can be omitted (0=emitted). If
              given,  this  is the static priority to the highest
              priority ecasound thread.  Other  ecasound  threads
              run with priority 'sched_priority-1...n'.


       -x     Truncate  outputs.  If  this is _not_ set, ecasound
              opens all outputs - if format allows it - in  read-
              write mode (-> prevents truncation).


       -z:feature
              Enable  'feature'.  '-z:db,dbsize'  enables double-
              buffering  for  audio  objects  that   support   it
              (dbzise=0  for  default,  otherwise  buffer size in
              sample frames). '-z:psr' enables  the  _p_r_e_c_i_s_e_-_s_a_m_-
              _p_l_e_-_r_a_t_e_s  mode for OSS-devices. See ecasoundrc(5).


       PPRROOCCEESSSSIINNGG CCOONNTTRROOLL

       -t:seconds
              Set processing time in seconds (doesn't have to  be
              an  integer  value).  If processing time isn't set,
              engine stops when all inputs are finished.


       -tl    Enable looping. When processing is finished, engine
              will start again from the initial position.

       See ecasound user's guide for more detailed documentation.


       -f:sample_format,channel,sample-rate,interleaving
              Set default sampling parameters. These are used for
              all  following  input  and  output  files  or until
              another -f is specified. If no -f  option  is  pre-
              sent, ecasound uses s16_le/2ch/44100/interleaved as
              the default value. Some audio objects may  override
              this altogether (for instance, RIFF WAVE inputs and
              outputs).

              Sample format is given as a a formatted string. The
              first  letter is either "u", "s" and "f" (unsigned,
              signed, floating point). The following number spec-
              ifies  sample  size  in  bits.  If sample is little
              endian, "_le" is added to the end. Similarly if big
              endian,  "_be" is added. If endianess is not speci-
              fied, host byte-order is used.  Currently supported
              formats  are  "u8" (same as "8"), "s16_le" (same as
              "16"),  "s16_be",  "s24_le",  "s24_be",   "s32_le",
              "s32_be", "f32_le" and "f32_be".

              The  4th  parameter 'interleaving' should either be
              'i' (default) for interleaved stream format, or 'n'
              for noninterleaved.


       -y:seconds
              Set starting position for last specified input/out-
              put. If you need more flexible control  over  audio
              objects, you should use the _._e_w_f format.


       -i[:]input-file-or-device
              Specifies  a  new input source that is connected to
              all selected chains.  Connecting multiple inputs to
              the  same  chain  isn't  possible. Input can be a a
              file,  device  or  some  other  audio  object  (see
              below).  If the input is a file, its type is deter-
              mined using the file name extension. Currently sup-
              ported formats are RIFF WAVE files (.wav), audio-cd
              tracks (.cdr), ecasound ewf-files (.ewf), RAW audio
              data  (.raw) and MPEG files (.mp2,.mp3). Also, for-
              mats supported by the SGI audiofile  library:  AIFF
              (.aiff, .aifc, .aif) and Sun/NeXT audio files (.au,
              .snd). MikMod is also supported (.xm,  .mod,  .s3m,
              .it,  etc).  MIDI  files (.mid) are supported using
              Timidity++. Similarly Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) can be read
              and   written  if  ogg123  and  vorbize  tools  are
              installed. Supported realtime devices are OSS audio
              devices   (/dev/dsp*),   ALSA  audio  and  loopback
              devices. If no inputs are specified, the first non-
              option   (doesn't  start  with  '-')  command  line

              argument is considered to be an input.


       -o[:]output-file-or-device
              Works in the same way as the -i option. If no  out-
              puts  are  specified,  the default output device is
              used (see &tilde;/.ecasoundrc).  Note!   you  can't
              output  to module formats supported by MikMod (this
              should be obvious) nor to ALSA's loopback device.

       ALSA devices
              When using ALSA drivers, instead of a device  file-
              name,  you need to use the following option syntax:
              --ii[[::]]aallssaa,,ccaarrdd__nnuummbbeerr,,ddeevviiccee__nnuummbbeerr.  If  you  need
              to       specify       individual       subdevices:
              --ii[[::]]aallssaa,,ccaarrdd__nnuummbbeerr,,ddeevviiccee__nnuummbbeerr,,ssuubbddeevviiccee__nnuumm--
              bbeerr.


       ALSA pcm-plugin layer
              Just  like  normal ALSA devices, but with automatic
              sample rate and format conversions.  Option  syntax
              is --ii[[::]]aallssaapplluuggiinn,,ccaarrdd__nnuummbbeerr,,ddeevviiccee__nnuummbbeerr,,ssuubbddee--
              vviiccee__nnuummbbeerr.


       ALSA loopback device
              By using the ALSA loopback  system,  you  can  grab
              audio data from any other pcm device. Option syntax
              is     --ii[[::]]aallssaallbb,,ccaarrdd__nnuummbbeerr,,ddeevviiccee__nnuummbbeerr,,ssuubbddee--
              vviiccee__nnuummbbeerr.


       aRts input/output
              If enabled at compile-time, ecasound supports audio
              input and output using aRts  audio  server.  Option
              syntax is --ii::aarrttss, --oo::aarrttss.


       Ecasound Wave Files - .ewf
              A  simple  wrapper  class  for handling other audio
              objects.   See  ecasound  user's  guide  for   more
              detailed information.


       Loop device
              Loop devices make it possible to route data between
              chains.  Option syntax  is  --[[iioo]][[::]]lloooopp,,iidd__nnuummbbeerr.
              If  you  add  a  loop  output with id '1', all data
              written to this output is routed to all loop inputs
              with id '1'. You can attach the same loop device to
              multiple inputs and outputs.



                            12.12.2000                          5

       Null inputs/outputs
              If you specify "null" or "/dev/null" as  the  input
              or  output, a null audio device is created. This is
              useful if you just  want  to  analyze  sample  data
              without  writing it to a file. There's also a real-
              time variant, "rtnull",  which  behaves  just  like
              "null"  objects, except all i/o is done at realtime
              speed.


       System standard streams and named pipes
              You can use standard streams (stdin and stdout)  by
              giving  "stdin" or "stdout" as the file name. Audio
              data is assumed to be in raw/headerless (.raw) for-
              mat.  If  you  want to use named pipes, create them
              with the proper file name extension before use.

       Ecasound has a powerful effect preset system  that  allows
       you create new effects by combining basic effects and con-
       trollers. See ecasound  user's  guide  for  more  detailed
       information.



       -pf:preset_file.eep
              Use   the   first  preset  found  from  file  'pre-
              set_file.eep' as a chain operator.


       -pn:preset_name
              Find  preset  'preset_name'  from   global   preset
              database  and  use it as a chain operator. See eca-
              soundrc(5) for info about the preset database.


       _S_I_G_N_A_L _A_N_A_L_Y_S_I_S



       -ev    Analyze sample data to find out how much the signal
              can  be  amplified  without clipping. The resulting
              percent value can be used as a parameter to -ea and
              -eas  effects.  Also prints a statistics table con-
              taining info about stereo-image and  how  different
              sample values are used.


       -ezf   Find  the  optimal  value for DC-adjusting. You can
              use the result as a parameter to -ezx effect.

       -eS:stamp-id
              Audio stamp. Takes a snapshot of passing audio data
              and stores it using id 'stamp-id' (integer number).
              This data can later  be  used  by  controllers  and
              other operators.


       -ea:amplify-%
              Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent.


       -eac:amplify-%,channel
              Amplifies  signal of channel 'channel' by amplify-%
              percent. 'channel' ranges from 1...n where n is the
              total number of channels.


       -eaw:amplify-%,max-clipped-samples
              Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent. If number of
              consecutive clipped samples (resulting  sample  has
              the   largest  amplitude  possible)  reaches  'max-
              clipped-samples', a warning will be issued.


       -eal:limit-%
              Limiter effect. Limits audio level to 'limit-%'.


       -ec:rate,threshold-%
              Compressor (a simple one). 'rate' is  the  compres-
              sion  rate  in  decibels ('rate' dB change in input
              signal causes 1dB change  in  output).  'threshold'
              varies  between  0.0  (silence) and 1.0 (max ampli-
              tude).


       -eca:peak-level-%, release-time-sec, fast-crate, crate
              A more advanced compressor (original  algorithm  by
              John  S.  Dyson).   If you give a value of 0 to any
              parameter, the  default  is  used.   'peak-level-%'
              essentially  specifies how hard the peak limiter is
              pushed.  The default of 69% is good. 'release_time'
              is  given  in  seconds.  This  compressor  is  very
              sophisticated, and actually  the  release  time  is
              complex.   This is one of the dominant release time
              controls, but the actual release time is  dependent
              on  a  lot of factors regarding the dynamics of the
              audio in. 'fastrate' is the compression  ratio  for
              the  fast  compressor.  This is not really the com-
              pression ratio.  Value of 1.0 is infinity  to  one,
              while the default 0.50 is 2:1.  Another really good
              value  is  special  cased  in  the  code:  0.25  is

              somewhat  less  than  2:1, and sounds super smooth.
              'rate' is the compression ratio for the entire com-
              pressor  chain.   The default is 1.0, and holds the
              volume  very  constant  without  many  nasty   side
              effects.    However   the  dynamics  in  music  are
              severely restricted, and a value of 0.5 might  keep
              the music more intact.


       -enm:threshold-level-%,pre-hold-time-msec,attack-time-
              msec,post- hold-time-msec,release-time-msec
              Noise  gate. Supports multichannel processing (each
              channel processed separately). When  signal  ampli-
              tude  falls below 'threshold_level_%' percent (100%
              means maximum amplitude), gate is activated. If the
              signal  stays below the threshold for 'th_time' ms,
              it's faded out during the attack phase of  'attack'
              ms.   If  the  signal  raises  above  the  'thresh-
              old_level' and stays there over 'hold' ms the  gate
              is released during 'release' ms.


       -ei:pitch-shift-%
              Pitch shifter. Modifies audio pitch by altering its
              length.


       -epp:right-%
              Normal pan effect. Balance value of 0 means to  pan
              signal  fully  left  and  100  fully  right. If the
              panned signal is a stereo signal,  left  and  right
              channels  aren't  mixed together.  Use the -erm and
              -erc effects to force  conversion  to  mono  before
              panning.


       -ezx:left-dc-fix-value,right-dc-fix-value
              Adjusts  the  signal DC by 'dc-fix-value'. Use -ezf
              to find the optimal value.

       -ef1:center_freq, width
              Resonant bandpass filter. 'center_freq' is the cen-
              ter frequency. Width is specified in Hz.


       -ef3:cutoff_freq, reso, gain
              Resonant lowpass filter. 'cutoffr_freq' is the fil-
              ter cutoff frequency. 'reso' means resonance.  Usu-
              ally  the best values for resonance are between 1.0
              and 2.0,  but  you  can  use  even  bigger  values.
              'gain'  is  the  overall gain-factor. It's a simple
              multiplier (1.0 is the  normal  level).  With  high
              resonance  values  it often is useful to reduce the
              gain value.


       -ef4:cutoff, resonance
              Resonant lowpass filter (3rd-order, 36dB,  original
              algorithm  by Stefan M. Fendt). Simulates an analog
              active RC-lowpass design. Cutoff is a value between
              [0,1], while resonance is between [0,infinity).


       -efa:delay-samples,feedback-%
              Allpass  filter.  Passes  all  frequencies  with no
              change in amplitude.  However, at the same time  it
              imposes a frequency-dependent phase-shift.


       -efc:delay-samples,radius
              Comb  filter. Allows the spikes of the comb to pass
              through.  Value of 'radius' should be  between  [0,
              1.0).


       -efb:center-freq,width
              Bandpass  filter.  'center_freq' is the center fre-
              quency. Width is specified in Hz.


       -efh:cutoff-freq
              Highpass  filter.  Only  frequencies  above   'cut-
              off_freq' are passed through.

              comb. There are 'delay_in_samples-2' spikes.  Value
              of  'radius' should be between [0, 1.0). The closer
              it is to the maximum value, the deeper the dips  of
              the comb are.


       -efl:cutoff-freq
              Lowpass   filter.   Only  frequencies  below  'cut-
              off_freq' are passed through.


       -efr:center-freq,width
              Bandreject filter. 'center_freq' is the center fre-
              quency. Width is specified in Hz.


       -efs:center-freq,width
              Resonator.  'center_freq'  is the center frequency.

              Delay effect. 'delay time' is  the  delay  time  in
              milliseconds.   'surround-mode'  is  a integer with
              following meanings: 0 = normal, 1 = surround,  2  =
              stereo-spread.  'number_of_delays'  should be obvi-
              ous. Beware that large number of  delays  and  huge
              delay times need a lot of CPU power. 'mix-%' deter-
              mines how much effected (wet) signal  is  mixed  to
              the original.

       -ete:room_size,feedback-%,wet-%
              A  more  advanced reverb effect (original algorithm
              by Stefan  M.  Fendt).   'room_size'  is  given  in
              meters, 'feedback-%' is the feedback level given in
              percents and 'wet-%' is the amount of reverbed sig-
              nal added to the original signal.


       -etf:delay-time-msec
              Fake-stereo  effect.  The input signal is summed to
              mono. The original signal goes to the left channels
              while a delayed version (with delay of 'delay time'
              milliseconds) is goes to the right.  With  a  delay
              time  of  1-40 milliseconds this adds a stereo-feel
              to mono-signals.

              reverbed  signal  moves  around  the  stereo image.
              'feedback-%' determines  how  much  effected  (wet)

       -gc:start-time,len
              Time crop gate. Initially  gate  is  closed.  After
              'start-time'  seconds  has  elapsed, gate opens and
              remains open for 'len' seconds. When closed,  pass-
              ing audio buffers are trucated to zero length.

              Threshold  gate.  Initially  gate  is closed. It is
              opened when volume goes over 'othreshold'  percent.
              After this, if volume drops below 'cthold' percent,
              gate is closed  and  won't  be  opened  again.   If
              'value_mode'  is 'rms', average RMS volume is used.

              Controllers  can  be  used  to  dynamically  change
              effect  parameters  during  processing.  All   con-
              trollers are attached to the selected (=usually the
              last specified effect/controller) effect. The first
              three  parameters  are  common for all controllers.
              'fx_param'  specifies  the  parameter  to  be  con-
              trolled.  Value  '1' means the first parameter, '2'
              the second and so on. 'start_value' and 'end_value'
              set  the  value  range. You really should see _e_x_a_m_-

       -kf:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,mode,genosc-number
              Generic oscillator. 'genosc_number' is  the  number
              of  the  oscillator  preset  to  be loaded. Mode is
              either '0' for static  values  or  '1'  for  linear
              interpolation.  The location for the preset file is
              taken from ./ecasoundrc (see _e_c_a_s_o_u_n_d_r_c_(_5_)).


       -kl:fx-param,start-value,end-value,time-seconds
              Linear envelope that starts from 'start_value'  and
              linearly     changes    to    'end_value'    during
              'time_in_seconds'. Can  be  used  for  fadeins  and
              fadeouts.


       -kl2:fx-param,start-value,end-value,1st-stage-length-
              sec,2nd- stage-length-sec
              Two-stage  linear  envelope,  a more versatile tool
              for  doing  fade-ins  and   fade-outs.   Stays   at
              'start_value'  for  '1st_stage_length'  seconds and
              then linearly changes  towards  'end_value'  during
              '2nd_stage_length' seconds.

              MIDI  continuous  controller  (control  change mes-
              sages).  Messages  on  the  MIDI-channel  'channel'
              that are coming from controller number 'controller'
              are used as the controller source. The  MIDI-device
              is  specified  in ./ecasoundrc (see _e_c_a_s_o_u_n_d_r_c_(_5_)).
              Defaults to _/_d_e_v_/_m_i_d_i.


       -ksv:fx-param,start-value,end-value,stamp-id,rms-toggle
              Volume  analyze  controller.  Analyzes  the   audio
              stored in stamp 'stamp-id' (see '-eS:id' docs), and
              creates control data based on the results. If 'rms-
              toggle'  is  non-zero, RMS-volume is used to calcu-
              late the control  value.  Otherwise  average  peak-
              amplitude is used.


       -kx    This  is a special switch that can be used when you
              need to control controller parameters with  another
              controller.   When you specify _-_k_x, the last speci-
              fied controller will be set as the control  target.
              Then you just add another controller as usual.
