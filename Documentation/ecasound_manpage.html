<h1>ecasound</h1>
<h2>27.08.2000</h2>


    
<p><h2>NAME</h2>
    ecasound - sample editor, multitrack recorder, fx-processor, etc.
<p><h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    
    <strong>ecasound</strong> [ general_options ] { [ chain_setup ] [ effect_setup ] [ input_setup ] [ output_setup ] }
<p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    
<p>Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, 
recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect 
processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. Ecasound supports 
a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms. Several
open-source audio packages, like for instance ALSA, OSS, mpg123, lame, 
libaudiofile and MikMod, are directly supported. One of the advantages 
of ecasound's chain-based design is that effects can easily be 
combined both in series and in parallel. Oscillators and MIDI-CCs 
can be used for controlling effect parameters. Included user-interfaces 
are ecasound - a versatile console mode interface, qtecasound - 
a Qt-based X-interface and various command-line utils suitable for 
batch processing.
<p><h2>OPTIONS</h2>
    
<p>Notice that the order of parameters given on the command
line is important!
<p><strong>GLOBAL OPTIONS</strong>
<dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-c</strong><dd>
Starts ecasound in interactive mode. In interactive mode you can
control ecasound with simple commands ("start", "stop", "pause",
etc.). See <a href="ecasound-iam_manpage.html">ecasound-iam(1)</a>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-d:debug_level</strong><dd>
Set the debug level to 'debug_level'. This a bitmasked value, 
that defaults to 3. See ECA_DEBUG class documentation for 
more detailed info about various debug_level values.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-q</strong><dd>
Quiet mode, no output. Same as <em>-d:0</em>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>--help</strong><dd>
Show this help.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>--version</strong><dd>
Print version info.
<p></dl>
<p><strong>CHAINSETUP OPTIONS</strong>
<dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-n:name</strong><dd>
Set the name of chainsetup to 'name'. If not specified, defaults
either to "command-line-setup" or to the file name from which
chainsetup was loaded. Whitespaces are not allowed.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-s[:]chainsetup-file</strong><dd>
Create a new chainsetup from file 'chainsetup-file' and add
it to the current session. Chainsetup can contain inputs, outputs, 
chains, effects, controllers, etc. A session, on the other hand, 
contains all the chainsetups. Although only one chainsetup can
be connected at a time, you can switch between them on-the-fly.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-sr:sample_rate</strong><dd>
Set internal sampling rate. This can be used to improve 
realtime performance or to avoid resampling. Default is 44100 
samples per second.
<p></dl>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong>
<dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-a:chainname1, chainname2, ...</strong><dd>
Select active signal chains. All effects, inputs and outputs are assigned to
these chains. If there are no -a options given, default chain is used.
Chain name 'all' is reserved and means that all chains are selected. By giving 
multiple -a options, you can control to which chains effects, inputs and outputs
are assigned to. Look at the 
<strong>EXAMPLES</strong>
section for more detailed info about the usage of this option.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-b:buffer size</strong><dd>
Sets the size of buffer in samples (must be an exponent of 2). This
is quite an important option. For real-time processing, you should
set this as low as possible to reduce the processing delay. Some
machines can handle buffer values as low as 64 and 128. In some
circumstances (for instance when using oscillator envelopes) small
buffer sizes will make envelopes act more smoothly. When not processing
in real-time (all inputs and outputs are normal files), values between
512 - 4096 often give better results. Default is 1024.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-m:mix-mode</strong><dd>
Force ecasound to use mix mode 'mix_mode'. 'auto' = automatic (default),
'simple' =  only one input/chain/output, 'normal' = normal single-threaded
mode and 'mthreaded' = multithreaded mixing. In most cases, ecasound is 
able to find out the correct mode automatically.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-r</strong><dd>
Use realtime scheduling policy (SCHED_FIFO). This is impossible if 
ecasound doesn't have root priviledges. Beware! This gives better 
performance, but can cause total lock-ups if something goes wrong.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-x</strong><dd>
Truncate outputs. If this isn't set, ecasound opens all outputs 
- if format allows it - in readwrite mode.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-z:feature</strong><dd>
Enable 'feature'. 'db' enables double-buffering for audio inputs 
that support it. 'psr' enables the <em>precise-sample-rates</em> mode 
for OSS-devices. See <a href="ecasoundrc_manpage.html">ecasoundrc(5)</a>.
<p></dl>
<p><strong>PROCESSING CONTROL</strong>
<dl>
<p></p><dt><strong>-t:seconds</strong><dd> 
Set processing time in seconds (doesn't have to be an integer value).
If processing time isn't set, engine stops when all inputs are 
finished.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-tl</strong><dd>
Enable looping. When processing is finished, engine will start 
again from the initial position.
<p></dl>
<p><strong>INPUT/OUTPUT SETUP</strong>
<p>See <a href="users_guide/users_guide.html">ecasound user's guide</a> for 
more detailed documentation.
<p><dl>
<p></p><dt><strong>-f:sample_format,channel,sample-rate</strong><dd>
Set default sampling parameters. These are used for all following
input and output files or until another -f is specified. If no -f
option is present, ecasound uses s16_le/2ch/44100 as the default
value. Some audio objects may override this altogether (for instance, 
RIFF WAVE inputs and outputs).
<p>Sample format is given as a a formatted string. The first letter is 
either "u", "s" and "f" (unsigned, signed, floating point). The 
following number specifies sample size in bits. If sample is 
little endian, "_le" is added to the end. Similarly if big endian, 
"_be" is added. If endianess is not specified, host byte-order is used. 
Currently supported formats are "u8" (same as "8"), "s16_le" (same 
as "16"), "s16_be", "s24_le", "s24_be", "s32_le", "s32_be", "f32_le" 
and "f32_be".
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-y:seconds</strong><dd>
Set starting position for last specified input/output. If 
you need more flexible control over audio objects, you should
use the <em>.ewf</em> format.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-i[:]input-file-or-device</strong><dd>
Specifies a new input source that is connected to all selected chains.
Connecting multiple inputs to the same chain isn't possible. Input
can be a a file, device or some other audio object (see below). 
If the input is a file, its type is determined using the file name 
extension. Currently supported formats are RIFF WAVE files (.wav), 
audio-cd tracks (.cdr), ecasound ewf-files (.ewf), RAW audio data
(.raw) and MPEG files (.mp2,.mp3). Also, formats supported by the
SGI audiofile library: AIFF (.aiff, .aifc, .aif) and Sun/NeXT audio 
files (.au, .snd). MikMod is also supported (.xm, .mod, .s3m, 
.it, etc). Supported devices are OSS audio devices (/dev/dsp*),
ALSA audio and loopback devices. If no inputs are specified, the first 
non-option (doesn't start with '-') command line argument is
considered to be an input.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-o[:]output-file-or-device</strong><dd>
Works in the same way as the -i option. If no outputs are specified,
the default output device is used (see &amp;tilde;/.ecasoundrc). Note! 
you can't output to module formats supported by MikMod (this should
be obvious) nor to ALSA's loopback device.
<p><em>OBJECT TYPE SPECIFIC NOTES</em>
<p></p><dt><strong>ALSA devices</strong><dd>
When using ALSA drivers, instead of a device filename, you need to
use the following option syntax: <strong>-i[:]alsa,card_number,device_number</strong>. 
If you need to specify individual subdevices:
<strong>-i[:]alsa,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number</strong>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>ALSA pcm-plugin layer</strong><dd>
Just like normal ALSA devices, but with automatic sample rate and format 
conversions. Option syntax is <strong>-i[:]alsaplugin,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number</strong>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>ALSA loopback device</strong><dd>
By using the ALSA loopback system, you can grab audio data from any
other pcm device. Option syntax is
<strong>-i[:]alsalb,card_number,device_number,subdevice_number</strong>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>aRts input/output</strong><dd>
If enabled at compile-time, ecasound supports audio input and 
output using aRts audio server. Option syntax is <strong>-i:arts</strong>,
<strong>-o:arts</strong>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>Ecasound Wave Files - .ewf</strong><dd>
A simple wrapper class for handling other audio objects. 
See <a href="users_guide/users_guide.html">ecasound user's guide</a> for more 
detailed information.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>Loop device</strong><dd> 
Loop devices make it possible to route data between chains.
Option syntax is <strong>-[io][:]loop,id_number</strong>. If you add a loop 
output with id '1', all data written to this output is routed
to all loop inputs with id '1'. You can attach the same loop
device to multiple inputs and outputs.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>Null inputs/outputs</strong><dd>
If you specify "null" or "/dev/null" as the input or output, 
a null audio device is created. This is useful if you just want
to analyze sample data without writing it to a file.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>System standard streams and named pipes</strong><dd>
You can use standard streams (stdin and stdout) by giving "stdin" 
or "stdout" as the file name. Audio data is assumed to be in
raw/headerless (.raw) format. If you want to use named pipes, 
create them with the proper file name extension before use.
<p></dl>
<p><strong>EFFECT SETUP</strong>
<p><em>PRESETS</em>
<p>Ecasound has a powerful effect preset system that allows you create
new effects by combining basic effects and controllers. See
<a href="users_guide/users_guide.html">ecasound user's guide</a> for more 
detailed information.
<p><dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-pf:preset_file.eep</strong><dd>
Use the first preset found from file 'preset_file.eep' as 
a chain operator.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-pn:preset_name</strong><dd>
Find preset 'preset_name' from global preset database and use
it as a chain operator. See ecasoundrc(5) for info about the 
preset database.
<p></dl>
<p><em>SIGNAL ANALYSIS</em>
<p><dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ev</strong><dd>
Analyze sample data to find out how much the signal can
be amplified without clipping. The resulting percent value
can be used as a parameter to -ea and -eas effects. Also prints 
a statistics table containing info about stereo-image and
how different sample values are used.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ezf</strong><dd>
Find the optimal value for DC-adjusting. You can use the result
as a parameter to -ezx effect.
<p></dl>
<p><em>GENERAL SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS</em>
<dl>
<p></p><dt><strong>-ea:amplify-%</strong><dd>
Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent. 
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-eac:amplify-%,channel</strong><dd>
Amplifies signal of channel 'channel' by amplify-% percent. 'channel'
ranges from 1...n where n is the total number of channels.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-eaw:amplify-%,max-clipped-samples</strong><dd>
Amplifies signal by amplify-% percent. If number of consecutive
clipped samples (resulting sample has the largest amplitude
possible) reaches 'max-clipped-samples', a warning will be issued.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-eal:limit-%</strong><dd>
Limiter effect. Limits audio level to 'limit-%'.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ec:rate,threshold-%</strong><dd>
Compressor (a simple one). 'rate' is the compression rate in
decibels ('rate' dB change in input signal causes 1dB change 
in output). 'threshold' varies between 0.0 (silence) and
1.0 (max amplitude).
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-eca:peak-level-%, release-time-sec, fast-crate, crate</strong><dd>
A more advanced compressor (original algorithm by John S. Dyson). 
If you give a value of 0 to any parameter, the default is used.
'peak-level-%' essentially specifies how hard the peak limiter
is pushed.  The default of 69% is good. 'release_time' is given 
in seconds. This compressor is very sophisticated, and actually
the release time is complex.  This is one of the dominant release 
time controls, but the actual release time is dependent on a lot of 
factors regarding the dynamics of the audio in. 'fastrate' is the 
compression ratio for the fast compressor.  This is not really 
the compression ratio.  Value of 1.0 is infinity to one, while the 
default 0.50 is 2:1.  Another really good value is special cased in 
the code: 0.25 is somewhat less than 2:1, and sounds super smooth.
'rate' is the compression ratio for the entire compressor chain.  
The default is 1.0, and holds the volume very constant without many nasty
side effects.  However the dynamics in music are severely restricted,
and a value of 0.5 might keep the music more intact.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-enm:threshold-level-%,pre-hold-time-msec,attack-time-msec,post-hold-time-msec,release-time-msec</strong><dd>
Noise gate. Supports multichannel processing (each channel 
processed separately). When signal amplitude falls below
'threshold_level_%' percent (100% means maximum amplitude), gate 
is activated. If the signal stays below the threshold for 
'th_time' ms, it's faded out during the attack phase of 
'attack' ms. If the signal raises above the 'threshold_level' 
and stays there over 'hold' ms the gate is released during 
'release' ms.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ei:pitch-shift-%</strong><dd>
Pitch shifter. Modifies audio pitch by altering its length.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-epp:right-%</strong><dd>
Normal pan effect. Balance value of 0 means to pan signal fully
left and 100 fully right. If the panned signal is
a stereo signal, left and right channels aren't mixed together.
Use the -erm and -erc effects to force conversion to mono before 
panning.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ezx:left-dc-fix-value,right-dc-fix-value</strong><dd>
Adjusts the signal DC by 'dc-fix-value'. Use -ezf to find the
optimal value.
<p></dl>
<p><em>FILTER EFFECTS</em>
<dl>
<p></p><dt><strong>-ef1:center_freq, width</strong><dd>
Resonant bandpass filter. 'center_freq' is the center frequency. Width
is specified in Hz. 
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ef3:cutoff_freq, reso, gain</strong><dd>
Resonant lowpass filter. 'cutoffr_freq' is the filter cutoff
frequency. 'reso' means resonance. Usually the best values for
resonance are between 1.0 and 2.0, but you can use even bigger values.
'gain' is the overall gain-factor. It's a simple multiplier (1.0 
is the normal level). With high resonance values it often is useful 
to reduce the gain value.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ef4:cutoff, resonance</strong><dd>
Resonant lowpass filter (3rd-order, 36dB, original algorithm by Stefan
M. Fendt). Simulates an analog active RC-lowpass design. Cutoff is a
value between [0,1], while resonance is between [0,infinity).
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efa:delay-samples,feedback-%</strong><dd>
Allpass filter. Passes all frequencies with no change in amplitude.
However, at the same time it imposes a frequency-dependent 
phase-shift.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efc:delay-samples,radius</strong><dd>
Comb filter. Allows the spikes of the comb to pass through.
Value of 'radius' should be between [0, 1.0).
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efb:center-freq,width</strong><dd>
Bandpass filter. 'center_freq' is the center frequency. Width
is specified in Hz. 
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efh:cutoff-freq</strong><dd>
Highpass filter. Only frequencies above 'cutoff_freq' are passed
through.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efi:delay-samples,radius</strong><dd>
Inverse comb filter. Filters out the spikes of the comb. There
are 'delay_in_samples-2' spikes. Value of 'radius' should be 
between [0, 1.0). The closer it is to the maximum value,
the deeper the dips of the comb are.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efl:cutoff-freq</strong><dd>
Lowpass filter. Only frequencies below 'cutoff_freq' are passed
through.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efr:center-freq,width</strong><dd>
Bandreject filter. 'center_freq' is the center frequency. Width
is specified in Hz. 
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-efs:center-freq,width</strong><dd>
Resonator. 'center_freq' is the center frequency. Width is specified
in Hz. Basicly just another resonating bandpass filter.
<p></dl>
<p><em>CHANNEL MIXING / ROUTING</em>
<dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-erc:from-channel, to-channel</strong><dd>
Copy channel 'from_channel' to 'to_channel'. If 'to_channel' 
doesn't exist, it is created. Channel indexing is started from 1.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-erm:to-channel</strong><dd>
Mix all channels to channel 'to_channel'.  If 'to_channel' 
doesn't exist, it is created. Channel indexing is started from 1.
<p></dl>
<p><em>TIME-BASED EFFECTS</em>
<dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etc:delay-time-msec,variance-time-samples,feedback-%,lfo-freq</strong><dd>
Chorus.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etd:delay-time-msec,surround-mode,number-of-delays,mix-%</strong><dd>
Delay effect. 'delay time' is the delay time in milliseconds.
'surround-mode' is a integer with following meanings: 0 = normal, 
1 = surround, 2 = stereo-spread. 'number_of_delays' should be 
obvious. Beware that large number of delays and huge delay times 
need a lot of CPU power. 'mix-%' determines how much effected (wet)
signal is mixed to the original.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ete:room_size,feedback-%,wet-%</strong><dd>
A more advanced reverb effect (original algorithm by Stefan M. Fendt). 
'room_size' is given in meters, 'feedback-%' is the feedback level
given in percents and 'wet-%' is the amount of reverbed signal added 
to the original signal.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etf:delay-time-msec</strong><dd>
Fake-stereo effect. The input signal is summed to mono. The
original signal goes to the left channels while a delayed 
version (with delay of 'delay time' milliseconds) is goes to
the right. With a delay time of 1-40 milliseconds this 
adds a stereo-feel to mono-signals. 
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etl:delay-time-msec,variance-time-samples,feedback-%,lfo-freq</strong><dd>
Flanger.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etm:delay-time-msec,number-of-delays,mix-%</strong><dd>
Multitap delay. 'delay time' is the delay time in milliseconds.
'number_of_delays' should be obvious. 'mix-%' determines how much 
effected (wet) signal is mixed to the original.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etp:delay-time-msec,variance-time-samples,feedback-%,lfo-freq</strong><dd>
Phaser.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-etr:delay-time,surround-mode,feedback-%</strong><dd>
Reverb effect. 'delay time' is the delay time in milliseconds.
If 'surround-mode' is 'surround', reverbed signal moves around the
stereo image. 'feedback-%' determines how much effected (wet)
signal is fed back to the reverb.
<p></dl>
<p><em>LADSPA-PLUGINS</em>
<dl>
<p></p><dt><strong>-el:plugin_unique_name,param-1,...,param-N</strong><dd>
Ecasound supports LADSPA-effect plugins (Linux Audio Developer's Simple
Plugin API). Plugins are located in shared library (.so) files in 
/usr/local/share/ladspa (configured in ecasoundrc(5)). One shared
library file can contain multiple plugin objects, but every plugin 
has a unique plugin name. This name is used for selecting plugins. 
See <a href="http://audio.netpedia.net/lad">LAD mailing list web site</a> for
more info about LADSPA. Other useful sites are <a href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA home
page</a> and <a href="http://www.ffem.org/gdam/ladspa-doc/ladspa.html">LADSPA
documentation</a>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-eli:plugin_unique_number,param-1,...,param-N</strong><dd>
Same as above expect plugin's unique id-number is used. It
is guaranteed that these id-numbers are unique among all 
LADSPA plugins.
<p></dl>
<p><strong>GATE SETUP</strong>
<p><dl>
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-gc:start-time,len</strong><dd>
Time crop gate. Initially gate is closed. After 'start-time' seconds
has elapsed, gate opens and remains open for 'len' seconds.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-ge:open-threshold-%, close-thold-%,volume-mode</strong><dd>
Threshold gate. Initially gate is closed. It is opened when volume 
goes over 'othreshold' percent. After this, if volume drops below 
'cthold' percent, gate is closed and won't be opened again. 
If 'value_mode' is 'rms', average RMS volume is used. Otherwise
peak average is used. 
<p></dl>
<p><strong>CONTROL ENVELOPE SETUP</strong>
<dl>
<p>Controllers can be used to dynamically change effect parameters
during processing. All controllers are attached to the selected
(=usually the last specified effect/controller) effect. The first
three parameters are common for all controllers. 'fx_param' 
specifies the parameter to be controlled. Value '1' means 
the first parameter, '2' the second and so on. 'start_value' 
and 'end_value' set the value range. You really should see
<em>examples.html</em> for some more info. 
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-kos:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,i-phase</strong><dd>
Sine oscillator with frequency of 'freq' Hz and initial phase
of 'i_phase' times pi.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-kf:fx-param,start-value,end-value,freq,genosc-number</strong><dd>
Generic oscillator. 'genosc_number' is the number of the 
oscillator preset to be loaded. The location for the preset
file is taken from ./ecasoundrc (see <em>ecasoundrc(5)</em>).
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-kl:fx-param,start-value,end-value,time-seconds</strong><dd>
Linear envelope that starts from 'start_value' and linearly 
changes to 'end_value' during 'time_in_seconds'. Can
be used for fadeins and fadeouts.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-kl2:fx-param,start-value,end-value,1st-stage-length-sec,2nd-stage-length-sec</strong><dd>
Two-stage linear envelope, a more versatile tool for doing fade-ins
and fade-outs. Stays at 'start_value' for '1st_stage_length' seconds
and then linearly changes towards 'end_value' during
'2nd_stage_length' seconds.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-km:fx-param,start-value,end-value,controller,channel</strong><dd>
MIDI continuous controller (control change messages). 
Messages on the MIDI-channel 'channel' that are coming from
controller number 'controller' are used as the controller
source. The MIDI-device is specified in ./ecasoundrc (see 
<em>ecasoundrc(5)</em>). Defaults to <em>/dev/midi</em>.
<p><p></p><dt><strong>-kx</strong><dd>
This is a special switch that can be used when you need
to control controller parameters with another controller. 
When you specify <em>-kx</em>, the last specified controller 
will be set as the control target. Then you just add
another controller as usual.
