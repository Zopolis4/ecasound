sect(Compiling)
subsect(Errors when compiling audioio-af.cpp)

Upgrade your audiofile headers. At least 0.1.6 version of the library 
has duplicate extern "C" -wrappers in the file em(aupvlist.h). The result
looks like this:
verb(--cut--
In file included from audioio-af.cpp:28:
/usr/local/include/audiofile.h:603: parse error before `}'
make[3]: *** [audioio-af.o] Error 1 
--cut--)

subsect(Errors when linking samplebuffer.o)

If you get errors that look something like this...
verb(--cut--
samplebuffer.o(.text+0x1bb): undefined reference to `SAMPLE_BUFFER::is_system_littleendian
--cut--)

... you have a incompatible version of libstdc++. As ecasound uses
many advanced features of standard C++, it requires libstdc++ 2.9.0
or newer.

subsect(If ecasound crashes - how to compile for debugging?)

The easiest way is to increase debug level (-d:level option). This
gives you a lot of info. Sometimes however, this is not enough. For 
debugging purposes, you should compile a separate debug version of 
ecasound. You can do this with "make distclean ; ./configure --enable-debug 
; make install". This produces a new set of executables and libraries 
(libecasound_debug.so, ecasound_debug, qtecasound_debug, etc). Notice
that these are em(considerably slower) than normal optimized
versions. To summarize, if ecasound acts weirdly, try to reproduce 
the behaviour with _debug versions. This way all assertions are
checked and extra debugging information helps to trace problems with
gdb.

sect(Installing)
subsect(Is installing Qt 2.0 going to break KDE and other apps using Qt 1.xx?)

You can install the Qt 2.0 runtime libs and still run apps using the
older Qt versions (like KDE). If you compile KDE/Qt programs yourself, 
you can choose between Qt 1.x and 2.x by changing the symbolic link 
"libqt.so". If it points to libqt.so.1, the program is linked to 1.x 
libs and to 2.x libs if it points to libqt.so.2.

See url(this ecasound-list message)(http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/ecasound-list/199909/0073.html)
for more info.

And of course you can just use the text-mode version of ecasound.
It can do most things that the X-version (qtecasound) can do.

subsect(Does qtecasound require KDE to be installed?)

No. In addition to the Qt runtime libraries, qtecasound only 
requires the normal X libraries. In other words it should run
under any window manager. And most likely it will also stay 
this way. I might do a KDE/some-other specific version, but
I'd still support the generic version. After all, ecasound isn't
actually aimed at the masses... 

sect(Using)
subsect(Can't open shared shared libraries)
If you get the following error message...

verb(--cut--
error in loading shared libraries: libecasound.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such
file or directory
--cut--)

Add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and run "ldconfig". If
you haven't installed ecasound to the default location, replace
/usr/local/lib with the correct library path.

subsect(How do I use the parameter xxx?)
The best place to start is the file em(examples.html). It can be found
from url(www.wakkanet.fi/ecasound)(http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/Documentation/examples.html)
(ecasound home page). Next you should check the em(ecasound(1)) manual
page. Finally, help given by the bf(-h) command line 
option is always up-to-date. If you still don't know what to do, mail me at 
email(kaiv@wakkanet.fi). 

subsect(Ecasound isn't doing anything but it still seems to hog all CPU-time)
You're probably running ecasound in raised-priority mode. It is turned on
with the -r command line option or by specifying 
"default-to-raisepriority true" in your url(~/.ecasoundrc)(ecasoundrc_manpage.html).

subsect(What file format should I use for mixing and recording?)
You should always use .raw or .wav. By doing this, you will probably
get better performance as these formats are internally supported by 
ecasound.
