<h2>1: Compiling</h2>
<p>
<a name="l2"></a>
<h3>1.1: Errors when compiling audioio-af.cpp</h3>
Upgrade your audiofile headers. At least 0.1.6 version of the library 
has duplicate extern "C" -wrappers in the file <em>aupvlist.h</em>. The result
looks like this:
<pre>
--cut--
In file included from audioio-af.cpp:28:
/usr/local/include/audiofile.h:603: parse error before `}'
make[3]: *** [audioio-af.o] Error 1 
--cut--
</pre>

<h3>1.2: If ecasound crashes - how to compile for debugging?</h3>
The easiest way is to increase debug level (-d:level option). This
gives you a lot of info. Sometimes however, this is not enough. For 
debugging purposes, you should compile a separate debug version of 
ecasound. You can do this with "make distclean ; ./configure --enable-debug 
; make install". This produces a new set of executables and libraries 
(libecasound_debug.so, ecasound_debug, etc). Notice
that these are <em>considerably slower</em> than normal optimized
versions. To summarize, if ecasound acts weirdly, try to reproduce 
the behaviour with _debug versions. This way all assertions are
checked and extra debugging information helps to trace problems with
gdb.

<h3>1.3: How to rebuild the source-RPMs with ALSA support?</h3>
If you have ALSA installed properly, normal rebuild is enough:
"rpm --rebuild ecasound-x.y.zrt.src.rpm" (replace x, y, z and t 
with proper version numbers).

<h2>2: Using</h2>
<p>
<a name="l6"></a>
<h3>2.1: Can't open shared shared libraries</h3>
If you get the following error message...
<p><pre>
--cut--
error in loading shared libraries: libecasound.so.x: cannot open shared object file: No such
file or directory
--cut--
</pre>

<p>Add /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf and run "/sbin/ldconfig". If
you haven't installed ecasound to the default location, replace
/usr/local/lib with the correct library path. If the it still doesn't
work, use "ldd /usr/local/bin/ecasound/" to see what library ecasound 
tries to use. 
<p>Same applies to other libraries used by ecasound (libkvutils, libaudiofile, etc).

<h3>2.2: How do I use the parameter xxx?</h3>
The best place to start is the file <em>examples.html</em>. It can be found
from <a href="http://www.wakkanet.fi/~kaiv/ecasound/Documentation/examples.html">www.wakkanet.fi/ecasound</a>
(ecasound home page). Next you should check the <em>ecasound(1)</em> manual
page. Finally, help given by the <strong>-h</strong> command line 
option is always up-to-date. If you still don't know what to do, mail me at 
<a href="mailto:kaiv@wakkanet.fi"><em>kaiv@wakkanet.fi</em></a>.

<h3>2.3: Ecasound isn't doing anything but it still seems to hog all CPU-time</h3>
You're probably running ecasound in raised-priority mode. It is turned on
with the -r command line option or by specifying 
"default-to-raisepriority true" in your <a href="ecasoundrc_manpage.html">~/.ecasoundrc</a>.
<p>
<a name="l9"></a>
<h3>2.4: What file format should I use for mixing and recording?</h3>
You should always use .raw or .wav. By doing this, you will probably
get better performance as these formats are internally supported by 
ecasound.
