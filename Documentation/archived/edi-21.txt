(edi-21) Review of object position functionality
	- submitted: kaiv, 31.01.2002
	- done: kaiv, 01.02.2002

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details:

- goals 
  - find out which objects contain audio position and length 
    information [done!]
  - determine how different objects behave when position (or length)
    is set in different situations (chainsetup connected/disconnect, 
    with/without engine running) [done!]
  - add concept of current position to controller objects (to 
    make for example fade-ins work even if chainsetup position 
    is changed during operation) [done!]
  - make sure all ECI commands work correctly in all 
    situations described above [done!]
  - update documentation [done!]
- technical details
  - separate ECA_AUDIO_POSITION from ECA_AUDIO_FORMAT; make 
    both of them inherit ECA_SAMPLERATE_AWARE [done!]
  - implement ECA_CHAINSETUP_POSITION using ECA_AUDIO_POSITION [done!]
- open issues
  - what's the role of ECA_AUDIO_TIME? [=> separate concrete class]
  - should new functionality (locations, alternative position
    representations) be added to ECA_AUDIO_POSITION? [=> maybe, 
    now it involves much less work than before]
- changelog
  - added: edi-21 implemented; a much improved framework 
	   for handling audio position information is now
 	   in place; -kl, -kl2 and -klg are now position 
	   aware - changing chainsetup position also affects
	   controller sources
  - removed: ia-mode - 'c-rewind', 'c-forward' and 
	     'c-setpos'
  - changed: looping with -tl always loops from the start; 
	     -y can't be used for offseting loop start 
 	     offset -> use ewf-files instead
