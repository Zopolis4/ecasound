       Ecasound  library  contains  an  interpreter  module  that
       understands a set of commands aimed at controlling various
       library services.  This is called the ecasound interactive
       mode (EIAM). All programs linked to ecasound  library  can
       use this facility.

       A special case of EIAM use is ecasound's control interface
       (ECI), which is a small library providing easy  access  to
       the  EIAM  commands from outside libecasound. When issuing
       EIAM commands using ECI, it's possible that commands  also
       return information. Currently supported return value types
       are: strings [s], list of strings [S], integers [i],  long
       integers  [li] and floating-point numbers [f]. These defi-
       nitions are used throughout this document.

       quit, q
              Quit ecasound session. What this means in  practice
              depends  on  the  client  (library throws an excep-
              tion).


       start, t
              Processing is started (play).


       stop, s
              Stop processing.


       run    Like 'start' but blocks until  processing  is  fin-
              ished.


       debug 'debug-level'
              Set  debug  level  to  'debug-level'.  Notice  that
              client programs can reimplement the debug routines.

       forward 'time-in-seconds', fw 'ttime-in-seconds'
              The current position is forwarded by  'time-in-sec-
              onds' seconds.


       setpos 'time-in-seconds', set-position 'time-in-seconds'
              Sets the current position to 'time-in-seconds' sec-
              onds from the beginning.

       One powerful feature of interactive-mode is that it under-
       stands  ecasound's  command-line  syntax directly. This is
       often the easiest  way  to  add  effects  and  files.  For
       instance,  command  "-efb:400,200"  means  that a bandpass
       filter is added  to  the  currently  selected  chainsetup-
       chains  combination,  with  initial parameters 400 (center
       frequency) and 200 (width in Hz).

       Chainsetup is the central data object. All  other  objects
       (inputs,  outputs,  chains,  etc)  are  connected  to some
       chainsetup. There can be many chainsetups but only one can
       be   connected.  Similarly  only  one  chainsetup  can  be
       selected. If not otherwise specified operations  are  done
       on  the  selected chainsetup. Some operations also require
       that selected chainsetup is not connected.


       cs-add 'name'
              Adds a new chainsetup with name 'name'.  'name'  is
              now the selected chainsetup.

       cs-remove
              Removes currently selected chainsetup.


       cs-select 'name'
              Selects chainsetup 'name'.


       cs-index-select 'cs_index'
              Selects a chainsetup based on a short index string.
              Chainsetup names can be rather long.  This  command
              can  be  used  to  avoid  typing  these long names.
              'cs_index' format is "c<number>".  You  can  get  a
              list  of  all  chainsetups (and their indexes) with
              the 'cs-status' command.


       cs-selected
              Returns the name of currently selected  chainsetup.

       cs-load 'filename'
              Adds  a  new  chainsetup  by  loading  it from file
              'filename'.  'filename' is now the selected  chain-
              setup.


       cs-save
              Saves the currently selected chainsetup to file. If
              chainsetup was loaded from a file, the  saved  ver-
              sion  will replace the original. If it doesn't have
              a  default  filename,   it's   saved   to   "chain-
              setup_name.ecs".


       cs-save-as 'filename'
              Saves  currently selected chainsetup to file 'file-
              name'.


       cs-edit
              Currently selected chainsetup is saved to a  tempo-
              rary  file. This file is loaded to an external edi-
              tor (see ecasoundrc(5)). After editing, the  chain-
              setup is loaded back to ecasound.


       cs-connect
              Connect  currently  selected  chainsetup to engine.
              Only one chainsetup can be connected at a time.

              Set  processing time in seconds (doesn't have to be
              an integer value).


       cs-loop
              Enable looping. When processing is finished, engine
              will start again from the initial position.


       cs-set Interpret  general  chainsetup  parameters like for
              example "-b"  (buffersize),  "-m"  (mixmode),  "-n"
              (name), etc.  See ecasound(1) for more info.


       cs-format 'bits,channels,sample_rate'
              Set  the  default  sample  parameters for currently
              selected chainsetup.  For example cd-quality  audio
              would  be  "16,2,44100". This does the same as com-
              mand-line argument "-f" (see ecasound(1)).

       Chain is a simple signal flow abstraction. Every chain has
       one  input  and  one output. All chain operators and their
       controllers are attached to chains. Chains can  be  muted,
       unmuted  and  be  bypassed.  If  not otherwise stated, all
       operations are done to currently selected chainsetup.


       c-add 'cname1,...,cnameN'
              Adds a set of chains. Added  chains  are  automati-
              cally selected.


       c-select 'cname1,...,cnameN'
              Selects chains. Other chains are automatically des-
              elected.

              Clear selected chains by removing all chain  opera-
              tors  and  controllers.   Doesn't change how chains
              are connected to inputs and outputs.


       c-name 'new_name'
              Renames the selected chain. When  using  this  com-
              mand, only one chain must selected.


       c-muting
              Toggle  chain muting. When chain is muted, all data
              that goes through is muted.


       c-bypass
              Toggle chain bypassing.  When  chain  is  bypassed,
              sample data is passed through untouched.


       c-forward 'time_in_seconds', c-fw 'time_in_seconds'
              Inputs and outputs connected to selected chains are
              forwarded by 'time-in-seconds' seconds. Time should
              be  given  as  a floating point value (eg. 0.001 is

              to be unique. Similarly all output names need to be
              unique. However, it's possible that the same object
              name  exists  both as an input and as an output. If

       request  for  a new object, it goes through all registered
       regular expressions, and returns an object attached to the
       matching  expression.  Object maps can also provide a list
       of all registered objects.

       The  following dump commands are not meant for normal use.
       Their primary purpose is to provide an  easy  way  to  get
       internal state information from libecasound. All dump com-
       mands output a single line with syntax "key value" to  the
       selected output stream (defaults to stdout).


       dump-target 'filename'
              Set target stream for dumping.


       dump-status
              Dumps  engine  status - 'running', 'stopped', 'fin-
              ished' or 'notready'.


       dump-position
              Dumps the global position. Printed in seconds using
              a floating-point representation.


       dump-length
              Dumps  the  overall  processing  length. Printed in
              seconds using a floating-point representation.


       dump-cs-status
              Dumps status  string  for  the  currently  selected
              chainsetup  -  'connected',  'selected' or an empty

              string.


       dump-c-selected
              Dumps the name of currently selected chain.


       dump-aio-selected
              Dumps label of currently selected audio object.  If
              no object is selected, dumps an empty string.


       dump-aio-position
              Dumps position of currently selected audio objects.
              Printed in seconds, using a  floating-point  repre-
              sentation.


       dump-aio-length
              Dumps  length  of  currently selected audio object.
              Printed in seconds, using a  floating-point  repre-
              sentation.


       dump-aio-open-state
              Dumps  audio  object  state  info. Either 'open' or
              'closed'.


       dump-cop-value 'chainop,param'
              Dumps chain operator parameter value. 'chainop' and
              'param'  are  operator  and  parameter index values
              (1...n).
