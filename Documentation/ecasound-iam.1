       Ecasound  library  can be controlled with simple commands.
       This is called the interactive-mode. All  programs  linked
       to ecasound library can use this facility.

       Notice!  Hyphens  and underlines are both accepted in com-
       mand names (ie. c-add and c_add both work).

       quit, q
              Quit ecasound session. What this means in  practice
              depends  on  the  client  (library throws an excep-
              tion).


       start, t
              Processing is started (play).


       stop, s
              Stop processing.


       debug 'debug-level'
              Set  debug  level  to  'debug-level'.  Notice  that
              client programs can reimplement the debug routines.

       rewind 'time-in-seconds', rw 'time-in-seconds'
              Rewind the current  position  by  'time-in-seconds'
              seconds.


       forward 'time-in-seconds', fw 'ttime-in-seconds'
              The  current position is forwarded by 'time-in-sec-
              onds' seconds.


       setpos 'time-in-seconds'
              Sets the current position to 'time-in-seconds' sec-
              onds from the beginning.

       One powerful feature of interactive-mode is that it under-
       stands ecasound's command-line syntax  directly.  This  is
       often  the  easiest  way  to  add  effects  and files. For
       instance, command "-efb:400,200"  means  that  a  bandpass
       filter  is  added  to  the  currently selected chainsetup-
       chains combination, with initial  parameters  400  (center
       frequency) and 200 (width in Hz).

       Chainsetup  is  the central data object. All other objects
       (inputs, outputs,  chains,  etc)  are  connected  to  some
       chainsetup. There can be many chainsetups but only one can
       be  connected.  Similarly  only  one  chainsetup  can   be
       selected.  If  not otherwise specified operations are done
       on the selected chainsetup. Some operations  also  require
       that selected chainsetup is not connected.


       cs-add 'name'
              Add  a  new  chainsetup with name 'name'. 'name' is
              now the selected chainsetup.


       cs-remove
              Remove currently selected chainsetup.


       cs-select 'name'
              Select chainsetup 'name'.


       cs-index-select 'cs_index'
              Select chainsetup based on a  short  index  string.
              Chainsetup  names  can be rather long. This command
              can be used  to  avoid  typing  these  long  names.
              'cs_index'  format  is  "c<number>".  You can get a
              list of all chainsetups (and  their  indexes)  with
              the 'cs-status' command.


       cs-load 'filename'
              Add a new chainsetup by loading it from file 'file-
              name'.  'filename' is now the selected  chainsetup.


       cs-save
              Save  currently  selected  chainsetup  to  file. If

              chainsetup was loaded from a file,  it's  saved  to
              the  same  file. If it doesn't have a default file-
              name, it's saved to "chainsetup_name.ecs".


       cs-save-as 'filename'
              Save currently selected chainsetup to  file  'file-
              name'.


       cs-edit
              Currently  selected chainsetup is saved to a tempo-
              rary file. This file is loaded to an external  edi-
              tor  (see ecasoundrc(5)). After editing, the chain-
              setup is loaded back to ecasound.


       cs-connect
              Connect currently selected  chainsetup  to  engine.
              Only one chainsetup can be connected at a time.


       cs-disconnect
              Disconnect currently connected chainsetup.


       cs-length 'seconds'
              Set  processing time in seconds (doesn't have to be
              an integer value).


       cs-loop
              Enable looping. When processing is finished, engine
              will start again from the initial position.


       cs-set Interpret  general  chainsetup  parameters like for
              example "-b"  (buffersize),  "-m"  (mixmode),  "-n"
              (name), etc.  See ecasound(1) for more info.


       cs-format 'bits,channels,sample_rate'
              Set  the  default  sample  parameters for currently
              selected chainsetup.  For example cd-quality  audio
              would  be  "16,2,44100". This does the same as com-
              mand-line argument "-f" (see ecasound(1)).

       one  input  and  one output. All chain operators and their
       controllers are attached to chains. Chain  can  be  muted,
       unmuted  and it can be bypassed.  If not otherwise stated,
       all operations are done to currently selected  chainsetup.


       c-add 'cname1,...,cnameN'
              Add   chains.   Added   chains   are  automatically
              selected.


       c-select 'cname1,...,cnameN'
              Select chains.


       c-select-all
              Select all chains.


       c-remove
              Remove selected chains.


       c-clear
              Clear selected chains by removing all chain  opera-
              tors  and  controllers.   Doesn't change how chains
              are connected to inputs and outputs.


       c-name 'new_name'
              Rename selected chains. When  using  this  command,
              only one chain must selected.


       c-muting
              Toggle  chain muting. When chain is muted, all data
              that goes through is muted.


       c-bypass
              Toggle chain bypassing.  When  chain  is  bypassed,
              sample data is passed through untouched.


       c-forward 'time_in_seconds', c-fw 'time_in_seconds'
              Inputs and outputs connected to selected chains are
              forwarded by 'time-in-seconds' seconds. Time should
              be  given  as  a floating point value (eg. 0.001 is
              the same as 1ms). If audio objecst are connected to
              multiple  selected  chains,  they will be forwarded
              multiple times.

       c-rewind 'time_in_seconds', c-rw 'time_in_seconds'
              Inputs and outputs connected to selected chains are
              rewinded  by 'time-in-seconds' seconds. Time should
              be given as a floating point value  (eg.  0.001  is
              the same as 1ms). If audio objecst are connected to
              multiple selected chains, they  will  be  forwarded
              multiple times.


       c-setpos 'time_in_seconds'
              Set position of all inputs and outputs connected to
              selected chains to 'time_in_seconds'.


       c-status
              Print status info about all chains.

       aio-add-input 'input_format_string'
              Add  a  new  input object. See ecasound(1) man page
              for more  info  about  the  argument  format  ('-i'
              option).

              option).


       aio-select 'aobject_name'
              Select some audio object. 'aobject_name' is usually
              a file name, but not always.


       aio-index-select 'aobject_index'
              Select some  audio  object  based  on  short  index
              string.  Especially  file names can be rather long.
              This command can be used to avoid typing these long
              names when selecting audio objects. 'aobject_index'
              format is  "i<number>"  for  inputs  and  similarly
              "o<number>" for outputs.  You can get a list of all
              audio objects and their indexes with the  'aio-sta-
              tus' command.

       Chain operators are used to  process  and  analyze  sample
       data.   Controllers  are  used to control individual chain
       operator parameters.  Both types of objects  are  attached
       to  chains.  If  not  otherwise stated, currently selected
       chainsetup and chains are  used.  Also,  'chainop_id'  and
       'param_id'  are used to selected chain operators and their
       parameters. First valid value for these parameters is 1.


       cop-add 'cop_format_string'
              Add  a  new  chain  operator.  Argument  format  is
              "-<id_string>:par1,...,parN".  See  ecasound(1) man
              page for more info.


       cop-remove 'chainop_id'
              Remove chain operator.

       cop-set 'chainop_id, param_id, value'
              Change the value of a single chain operator parame-
              ter. Unlike other chain operator commands, this can
              also be used during processing.


       cop-remove-controller 'param_id'
