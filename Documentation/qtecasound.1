       qtecasound is a Qt-based X-interface to ecasound. It  uses
       the  same  engine as the the console mode version. Because
       of this, command line parameters and interactive-mode com-
       mands  work  identically.  Also  environment variables and
       files are used in the same manner. The idea behind  qteca-
       sound   is  to  provide  a  graphical  rruunnttiimmee  interface.
       Although usable, it still lacks many important features.


IINNTTEERRFFAACCEE
              The aim of qtecasound design has been  to  make  it
              easy to use and still retain efficiency.

              I   personally  don't  like  traditional  graphical
              interfaces very much. My biggest complaint is  that
              they are often inefficient in the hands of a expert
              user. When you've used some program for years,  you
              don't  need cute icons and menubars to remember how
              to do  some  specific  task.   Icons  and  menubars
              should be there for the beginners, but there should
              be alternatives for the more advanced users.

              Here's a few rules I try  to  follow  in  designing
              qtecasound interface:


       No hidden functions
              I've tried to avoid hiding functionality. All push-
              buttons and other  widgets  are  visible.  If  more
              functionality  is  needed, a new window is created.
              For instance I've tried  to  avoid  menubars  alto-
              gether.


       Keyboard shortcuts
              My  goal  is  that qtecasound can be used without a
              mouse. Shortcuts work everywhere.  All  pushbuttons
              have  a  short  description  and  shortcut keys are
              marked with parenthesis (for  example:  "S(t)art").
              Shortcuts are triggered using ALT-key. This applies
              to all shortcut keys.

       See  file  BUGS.  If  qtecasound  behaves  weirdly, try to
       increase the debug level to see what's going on.
